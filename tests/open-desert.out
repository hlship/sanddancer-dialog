Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all your dimming headlights
pick out before barely reaching the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; wiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air. On the dash you
can see a piece of jade. The glove compartment is closed.

> exit
You work the rusty truck door open. You get out of the pickup truck.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

> e
Outside the wavering glow of your headlights, it's black. Pitch. Storm must have
rolled in; there's no stars above, no anything but blackness around. Only the
smell of the desert tells you it's still out there.

> purloin flashlight

> turn it on
Your surroundings spring into brightness around you.

You heft your flashlight nervously, licking your lips, but decide not to head
out into the desert just yet. Your truck lights are already starting to dim, and
with how dark it is, you're not sure you could find your way back.

> (now) (#emergency-lights is on)
> open wallet
You open your wallet, revealing your driver's license and a receipt from Big
Jimmy's.

Something about the receipt from Big Jimmy's makes you want to brood about your
shit job.

> e
You walk east for a long time, thoughts turning over like the sand under your
sneakers. You think about your shit job. You think about Ocean and how pissed
she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to wait up for you
but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking
up you can't see a damn thing. You can't see your pickup, you can't see the
electrical tower. Not even your damn footprints. You're lost. Well, shit.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and every inch of sand looks just like
every other.

Nearby: a stand of cactus, a dead cow, and some clumps of sagebrush. Nothing to
write home about.

> s
You walk south.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and you plod wearily through
the sand.

All you can make out in the darkness are a dull grey boulder, a looming cactus,
and a stand of cactus.

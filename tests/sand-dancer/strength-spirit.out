but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Storage Room
Waves of sand flow like water through the room, filling it higher and higher.
You glance wildly at the exits south and up.

Barely able to reach the ladder through sand up to your waist, you haul yourself
up the rungs and pull free just in time.

Roof
Except it's more like a foundation now, the building's sunk almost entirely into
the sand.

The sand swirls and churns like something liquid or alive around you, and then
you look and see it is alive, thousands and thousands of lizards, little sand-
dancers, are burrowing up from somewhere underground, scattering and writhing in
some complex pattern.

Then, suddenly, everything stops.

And with a mighty heave, a huge lizard crests through the sand right in front of
you.

The lizard's tongue snakes through the air, tasting it, tasting you. One slitted
eye studies you intently. It pauses, as if waiting for you to say something.

You could say hello.

> x lizard
His scales are thick, sand still spilling off them in rivulets and trickles, and
they recede and collide in fractal complexities that make you dizzy. He rumbles
somewhere inside him, and sand jitters at his feet.

You could say hello.

Roof
Except it's more like a foundation now, the building's sunk almost entirely into
the sand.

Thousands of lizards writhe in the desert around you. The freaky giant lizard
sits before you, breathing, watching.

You could say hello.

> say hello
Stunned by what you see, you stammer out a greeting.

The ground rumbles as the lizards shift. "Hello," he says and his voice shakes
the earth and creaks the rusty joins of the tower. "Yes, hello, little one.
Strange thing to say when I've always been with you, watching, waiting. But
hello, hello at last, Nakaibito."

You could ask who he is or ask about the lizards.

> ask who
"Who, uh, what are you?" you stammer.

"I am Sand-dancer," he breathes flicking his tongue in and out, slowly. "I am
the desert and the dust and the rain and the wind. I was there the first time
you went hungry and the first time you made love and the last time you asked for
help, but I could not help you then. But tonight, Nakaibito, tonight I can."

You could ask what to do next or ask about the lizards.

No way, man. There's freaking lizards everywhere.

"I've been kicking around here all night, seems like I'm no closer to leaving
than when I started" you say.

"Much has happened tonight. You've made bargains and plans. You carry strength
that ripped warmth from walls. You have scent that brought you liquid motion.
But these things together do not help you. No, you still haven't decided." The
lizard stares at you with one eye, his great slittled eye blinking. "But now is
the time."

The ground shudders and shifts beneath you, and out of the sand rises some
canned oranges and a roll of duct-tape.

"The tape and gas can will return you to her. The blanket and the can of food
will look out for you. Take one."

Except it's more like a foundation now, the building's sunk almost entirely into

Thousands of lizards writhe in the desert around you. Sand-dancer sits before
you, breathing, watching.

On the sand before him are a roll of duct-tape and some canned oranges.

> take oranges
You take the canned oranges. As you do, the roll of duct-tape sinks into the
sand.

"By your actions and through your talents, you have chosen to survive the night
here, alone" he says, sighing as the lizards in the desert writhe and twitch.
"You have looked into yourself and found your story, the path you will walk
tomorrow."

He breathes. "And are you happy with your story?" he asks, and there's some
dangerous undertone to the question and you don't know why. The lizards tense,
quivering, twisting their little heads back and forth as they await your answer.

You could say yes, say no, or say you're not sure.

> say not sure
You open your mouth to say something and... no words come out. You don't know if
you've made the right choice or not. You stare helplessly at the giant lizard.

The lizard turns his head sharply, and all the lizards in the desert around
writhe angrily, clawing and biting at each other in agitation. "And when will
you know, Knock?" the lizard asks. "When will you own your life? When will you
become a man? Tonight. It must be tonight."

The little sand-dancers writher and chitter all around you.

A glistening egg rises from the sand, glowing with neon potential, the lizard
glances down at it almost dismissively. "This is spirit," he says, "the last
talent you need to achieve your goal, and you can have it for three memories.
But perhaps I have something else to trade."

The lizards whisper in anticipation as a second egg rises. This one's bigger,
and almost blinding with its intensity, and the lizards draw back, chittering in
awe and amazement. "This," Sand-dancer says, "is freedom. Pure, undiluted, and
absolute. Many crave it and few get a chance to take it. I offer it to you,
Nakaibito, but it does not come cheaply." He grins. "For freedom, you must give
up everything. You must give me all your memories."

The lizards begin to circle restlessly as they wait for you to choose. Sand-
dancer merely watches, and waits.

You could ask about spirit or ask about freedom.

> ask spirit
"How does spirit help me?" you ask.

"You have warmth and energy you need to stay through the night," he says, "but
to continue looking out for yourself, you will need spirit."

You could ask about freedom.

> ask freedom
"Freedom, huh? I bet I could use some of that" you say.

"With freedom, Nakaibito, you can make your troubles vanish. True freedom is the
power of unmaking the past, of undoing what's done and regretted. This power is
great and terrible, but I promise you." He flicks his tongue. "It will set you
free."

> trade job for spirit
He flicks out his tongue and pulls the memory of your shit job from your core,
swallowing it whole. "A good start," he says, "but you must trade more."

> trade last day for spirit
He flicks out his tongue and pulls the memory of your last day of high school
from your soul, swallowing it whole. "Yes," he says, "but more."

> trade road trips for spirit
Sand-dancer nods. "Yes," he says, "a fair trade." And something happens inside
you as he says it. The memory of road trips through the desert shifts and
wriggles and fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become
something else. And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it spirit.
Cool. "The choice is made," he rumbles, "your path is set. Goodbye, Nakaibito."
And he turns and dives into the sand. The lizards twist and writhe and follow
him.

And then, just as quiet settles, another huge rumble shakes the ground, and,
almost like an afterthought, the building breaches the sand and rises to the
surface.

Crumbling Concrete
This concrete building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned. Tendrils of desert sand drift
against a boarded-up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk
around to the east or head south back to your truck.

You have some canned oranges, a flashlight, a gas can, an emergency blanket,
your lighter, your wallet, and your emotional baggage. You're wearing your denim
jacket. You've gained the talents strength, scent, and spirit.

In your emotional baggage are the memories of watching Family Guy with Karl,
meeting Ocean, and your grandma's stories.

You go, and the night collapses in on you so hard you barely remember curling up
in a corner with the blanket, strong enough now to wait out the night.

In the morning some highway patrol dude shakes you awake with a lecture and a
ride back to town. Oro Oeste? he asks but you tell him no, take a left instead,
and you end up on a street corner in Pobre Vista and keep going. Seven Sticks
and then Gallup and then Flagstaff, hitching west. The cash in your wallet runs
out but a trucker buys you a value meal and you seem to have a knack for
sniffing out enough to stay fed and your blanket keeps you warm and you keep
going.

When you hit the Pacific you roll up your jeans and wade into the surf for the
first time in your life. And it's warm on the top and cool underneath and this
is all you want, this moment, this here and now. You'll find work and you'll
find love but you'll never find home and that's okay. It's okay. You wade deeper
and the waves lap higher and then a big one rolls in, blue and white, and you
feel strong, strong as it crests and smashes into you with the force of all the
water in the world, and you laugh and try to stay on your feet but it's too
late, you're crashing, you're crashing, you crash...

     *** You have spirit. ***

but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall. On the opposite wall is a closed
wire mesh cage, in which is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-fashioned
emergency radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

> open cage with key
You sling the key into the lock, but as you turn it, the rusted metal snaps off
inside. The crumbling fragments fall to the ground as you slam your fist against
the wire mesh in frustration. This is not your day.

Hey, that emergency blanket might be useful if you decide on spending the night
here.

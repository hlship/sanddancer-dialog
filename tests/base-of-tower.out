but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

> exit
The door creaks open with difficulty, rusted joints straining. You get out of
the pickup truck.

> n
You walk north.

Crumbling Concrete
This concrete building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned: a pane of cracked glass sparkles
faintly in the beam of your headlights. Tendrils of desert sand drift against a
boarded-up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk around to
the east or head south back to your truck.

> n
You walk north.

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand, one of three
legs of the huge electrical tower looming like some gargantuan spider into
blackness above you. A tumbleweed drifts lazily against the rusted metal among
scrawny weeds and bits of trash. Someone left a tin can here years ago: ridged
ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the building.

Something about the tumbleweed makes you want to brood about your last day of
high school.

Your surroundings spring into brightness around you.

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand; you shine your
flashlight up towards the tower looming above you. A tumbleweed drifts lazily
against the rusted metal among scrawny weeds and bits of trash. Someone left a
tin can here years ago: ridged ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the building.

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand; far above you,
a red warning light blinks on and off. A tumbleweed drifts lazily against the
rusted metal among scrawny weeds and bits of trash. Someone left a tin can here
years ago: ridged ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the glow of the
building.

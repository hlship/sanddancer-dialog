but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

You open your wallet, revealing your driver's license, a receipt from Big
Jimmy's, and a folded photo.

Something about the receipt from Big Jimmy's makes you want to brood about your

You take the pack of cigarettes out of the glove compartment.

The door creaks open with difficulty, rusted joints straining. You get out of
the pickup truck.

> n
You walk north.

Crumbling Concrete
This concrete building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned: a pane of cracked glass sparkles
faintly in the beam of your headlights. Tendrils of desert sand drift against a
boarded-up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk around to
the east or head south back to your truck.

> n
You walk north.

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand, one of three
legs of the huge electrical tower looming like some gargantuan spider into
blackness above you. A tumbleweed drifts lazily against the rusted metal among
scrawny weeds and bits of trash. Someone left a tin can here years ago: ridged
ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the building.

Something about the tumbleweed makes you want to brood about your last day of
high school.

You brush away remants of broken glass and wriggle through the window.

Staging Area
Faint shafts of light from your dimming headlights seep through the empty window
frame leading outside, but you can barely make out anything of the interior.

> feel desk
You feel around the edge of the desk, and find that it has a drawer.

> open drawer
You slide the drawer open by feel in the darkness. Something large and lumpy
rolls around inside--a flashlight?

> take flashlight
Yeah, it's a flashlight all right. You grip it in sudden relief, turning it in
your hands until your fingers find the switch.

> turn it on
Your surroundings spring into brightness around you.

Staging Area
It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner, revealing a hole criss-crossed with cobwebs.

The boarded-up door is southwest, alongside the empty window frame leading
outside; other rooms lie north and east.

You see a piece of jade here.

> take jade
You take the piece of jade.

> n

Foreman's Office
You sweep the beam of your flashlight around this tiny office, probably once
where the boss sat under a dust covered window. A half collapsed desk sits
against a wall. On the half-collapsed desk is a rusted key. Tacked to the wall
is a peeling safety poster.

The only exit is to the south.

Something about the rusted key makes you want to brood about meeting Ocean.

> take key
You take the rusted key off the half-collapsed desk.

Through a mass of cobwebs, you can see a roll of duct-tape down in the hole.

Hey, that roll of duct-tape might be useful if you decide on fixing the truck
and getting out of here.

> take tape
You reach your hand towards the hole, then pull back with a start as you brush
cobwebs. Nightmare visions of fat black spiders shudder through your brain. No
way are you reaching in there.

> e
You walk east.

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall. On the opposite wall is a closed
wire mesh cage, in which is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-fashioned
emergency radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

Hey, that emergency blanket might be useful if you decide on spending the night

Storage Room
The walls are lined with bare metal shelves, casting strange patterns of shadow
as you sweep your flashlight beam around. Mounted to the wall is a control panel
for the building's emergency lights. They are switched off. On the shelving are
hundreds of cans of food, the labels long since aged away. The break room lies
back to the south and a utility ladder climbs through a broken skylight to the
roof.

With a sharp buzz, a wiff of static, and an electrical groan, bare light bulbs
flicker on throughout the building.

> turn on radio
With a hiss and a crackle, the old radio comes to life.

> tune it to 102.3 khz
You tune the emergency radio to 102.3 khz.

Not like you think anything's going to happen, but what the hell. You grab the
dusty old mike, press the call button, and ask "Is there anybody out there?"

The speaker blurts and holy crap, someone's responding, and they say "Roger,
roger, tower station nineteen, read you now loud and clear, what's your forty?"
and the voice is staticky and whirled through with weird rythmic distortions but
you can hear it just fine and now what?

You could ask what ten forty means, say never mind, or say that you are lost.

> lost
Feeling a little stupid, you come clean and tell the voice that you drove off
the road and aren't sure really exactly where you are.

"Copy that," the voice says briskly after a moment. "You're at tower station
nineteen, son, about thirty-two miles southwest of Oro Oeste, fifteen miles or
so from the state highway." And if the mike wasn't attached to the radio you'd
drop it on the floor. Fifteen miles? How in the hell could you have driven
fifteen miles off the road and not remember? How is that even possible?

"Hello?" the radio says. "Hello son, do you copy?"

You could answer yes or turn off the radio.

> yes
You jabber something positive and sit back, still shaken.

"Look, son," the voice says, "I don't know how you got out there but that's not
important right now. Weather report's coming in and there's a cold front the
size of Texas coming your way. I don't want to scare you but if you don't find a
way home, or figure out some food and shelter for the night, you could freeze to
death. You hear me? Now on account of the cutbacks I don't have anyone to send
out there until morning. But there may be parts around that old tower you can
use to patch up your truck and make it back to the highway. Or, there may be
emergency supplies that would get you through the night. This storm's gonna blow
out all our communication, so you're gonna be on your own. It's up to you. Over
and out."

You rub your face tiredly. Ocean was expecting you tonight after your shift,
like usual. If you don't make it she'll be worried sick. Then on the other hand
maybe you should worry about yourself first for a change. You feel like you need
a cigarette and then you remember you quit. Hell, can't anything be easy?

You try to raise somone, but there's no response.

Roof
From the roof of the building, you can see the huge electrical tower rising up
in front of you. Some metal rungs once led to a control room higher up the
tower, but the lowest ones are well above your head. You'd have to jump out into
space to grab the bottom rung. A huge metal barrel stands upright and intact
nearby, large enough that you could climb up on it. At your feet is the way back
down.

Middle of Nowhere
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all you can see in the glow of
the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; whiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air.

A brown-colored lizard clings to the cactus.

Out of the corner of your eye you spot a glimpse of something moving in the
darkness, off in the desert to the east.

> e
You head off in the direction of movement, scanning with your flashlight over
the skittering shadows.

You walk east for a long time, thoughts turning over like the sand under your
sneakers. You think about your last day of high school. You think about Ocean
and how pissed she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to
wait up for you but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking
up you can't see a damn thing. You can't see your pickup, you can't see the
electrical tower. Not even your damn footprints. You're lost. Well, shit.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and god damn it's dark.

You can sort of see some clumps of sagebrush, a looming cactus, and a dead cow.

It's gone now... no, wait--a darting shadow to the east.

> e
You chase after the shadow, faster and faster, breath misting in the cold air.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and every inch of sand looks just like
every other.

Nearby: a dull grey boulder, a dead cow, and a looming cactus. Nothing to write
home about.

Hey, there it is again--something's moving to the northwest.

> nw
Some crazy thrill comes over you. You feel like a hunter. You can almost smell
the thing you're chasing in the air. You can smell it, fur and terror. You race
after it.

Open Desert
Your tracks are swallowed up in moments by the billowing sand, and god damn it's
dark.

All you can make out in the darkness are some dry bones, a dead cow, and a
looming cactus.

It's gone now... no, wait--a darting shadow to the east.

> e
Dodging after the fleeing, skittering shadow, you're almost caught up to it when
your foot trips on a rock and you stumble to the ground. But the ground doesn't
stop your fall, it collapses, and you're tumbling in a shower of dirt clods down
a hole, rolling down some crazy underground tunnel clutching at mud and roots,
till finally you slide into some damp, fetid place, and come up a stop against
something soft, huge, warm. And furry.

Burrow
Roots push through the earthen roof, casting weird shadows in the beam of your
flashlight. It's round and small and underground in here and filled with hot
sweat and animal stench. But mostly filled with something big and alive.

It's huge, covered in sweaty fur stained with mud, and a huge eye stares out you
above long black whiskers. You can feel its breath on your face and its
heartbeat thudding through the floor and you cringe back in terror against the
wall. It's… well.

It's a rabbit.

The rabbit breaths and stares. You wonder if it's going to start talking like in
some crap disney movie and then jesus christ it does...

"So, what'd you expect from an animal guardian?" it says, but like not with its
lips, somewhere in your head instead. "Were you thinking big, nasty, sharp,
pointy teeth? Waistcoat and pocket watch? Nah. Tricks are for kids. What's up
Knock?" Its whiskers twitch.

You could ask who the rabbit is or just, you know, go insane.

> insane
I know, right? Looks like it's too late though.

You could ask who the rabbit is.

> ask who
"Who, uh, what are you?" you ask.

"Oh come on, pal, you know me," he says with this kind of stupid cheerful tone,
and suddenly he looks more like Buster from Arthur, scrawny and poorly animated.
"I've been keeping an eye on you from the TV all these years. Your grandma asked
me to, remember?" He grins, buck teeth protruding.

You could ask about grandma's stories or tell the rabbit he's not real.

> tell not real
"But, you're not, like, real."

"Oh, don't say that!" the rabbit says, animated eyes going round like saucers.
"Then it'd be just you here all alone, and wouldn't that be boring. It's much
more interesting if I'm really around."

The rabbit stares intently at you, as if expecting something.

"Hey, yo, you been hella good about keepin' off those cancer sticks," Buster
says, except he's not Buster any more, more like Eminem. "Don't think I ain't
watchin' ya." (Oh hey, Rabbit Smith, you get it.)

You could ask how he knows so much about everything.

> everything
"I don't understand," you ask "how you know so much about me. Grandma.
Everything."

"Hey, back off man," he says, "it's my ***n' job." And there's actually like a
bleep, too, and now that you think of it you only ever saw 8 Mile on TV.

The rabbit's ears twitch a little, and he looks momentarily anxious.

"Anyway, look, man, we both know you're in trouble. I just gotta ask you one
question." And he changes again into like a giant silhouette, and it's the
Playboy Bunny, ears and bow tie and all. "Do you love her?"

You could tell him that you don't know, answer yes, or answer no.

> yes
"Well, yes, she's, well, she's Ocean." you say.

Something about the bunny's bow tie makes you want to brood about her graduation
night.

"Then you probably should get home and tell her," the bunny says. "Patch up that
truck and fly down the highway before she gets away." It winks.

The rabbit stares intently at you, as if expecting something.

"Look," he says, and now he's big and fluffy and smells like springtime and
peeps. "I can help you make your decisions. I'll trade you for one of these
talents." He holds out an easter basket filled with plastic green easter grass;
in it are two glowing orbs.

"Strength," hey says, pointing to the first one, "and courage. Pick whichever
one you think will be most useful, but you have to give me something back.
Something real, something I can work with."

You could ask about strength, ask about courage, ask about trading, or tell him
you don't want to trade.

> i
Did you want to:
1. tell him you don't want to trade, or
2. take inventory?
(Type the corresponding number)

> 2
You have a rusted key, a piece of jade, a flashlight, a pack of cigarettes, your
lighter, your wallet, and your emotional baggage. You're wearing your denim
jacket.

In your emotional baggage are the memories of her graduation night, meeting
Ocean, your last day of high school, your shit job, and your grandma's stories.

You could ask about strength, ask about courage, ask about trading, or tell him
you don't want to trade.

> trade last day for courage
The Rabbit nods. "Yes," he says, "a fair trade." And something happens inside
you as he says it. The memory of your last day of high school shifts and
wriggles and fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become
something else. And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it courage.
Cool.

"The others are coming," he says, "they'll be here soon," and now he looks like
Frank from Donnie Darko and his face is behind that freaky metal mask and his
voice is distorted and makes your skin crawl.

"Watch out for them," he says. "We all want to help, but... the others are
wilier than me. Look up."

"Look up, Naki," he says again.

> look up
Stupidly, you tilt your head back and stare up at the dirt ceiling, and all you
can see is blackness.

No wait... there's patterns, slowly shifting, barely visible in the darkness,
and miles away. Like clouds. And then a drop of water falls on your face, and
then another, and you realize suddenly you're outside, and it's starting to
rain...

Backtracking
It's quieter and darker over here, the black desert night bleeding in. Your tire
track are hardly visible in the desert sand, and you can barely make out the way
north back to your truck.

Rain starts to come down, pattering on the desert sand. Soon it's gonna be a
muddy deathtrap out here.

With a sudden growl of static, the radio springs to life and it freaks the hell
out of you. The voice weaves in and out of crazy whirling distortion and
shifting blasts of static. "Hey... receiving? ...never told... you'll never,
never--" A wail like an 8-bit banshee screams through the signal. "...waste of
time... who do you think? ..." Static, static. "Very soon now, Nak...
akaibito... very..."

all.

Control Center
Some kind of electrical control stuff must have happened here once, but it's
totally trashed now. Like, piles of trash, broken equipment, and junk are
everywhere. But hey, on one pile there's a perfectly good can opener.

You catch a faint whiff of gasoline coming from somewhere.

Na... know where.... never going to work. Never g--" And the voice cuts off,
replaced by a low, tooth-rattling hum.

first guy you talked to but it sounds like someone else now too, someone you

towards the biggest coyote with a terrible scream.

It flinches back, suddenly unsure, and you charge at it full speed, still
screaming, arms outstretched, until it turns tail and bolts away. The other
coyotes circle uncertainly, but you turn your snarling furious rage on them too
and then they're all scattering, mangy shadows slinking away into the desert.
Except for one last coyote who stands his ground.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

> yes
It's freezing out and your nerves are jangled. "Sure, I could use a smoke" you
say.

You pull out your pack and he grins, like he knew you'd say yes, and leans
forward for you to light up off him. His sunglasses reflect back nothing but
your own face weirdly lit by the glow from the cig, and for a moment it's like
the blackness behind them is deep, deeper than the sky, deeper than the
universe...

The rabbit twitches a little and looks a you expectantly.

"Gotta keep an eye on the horizon," he says in a scratchy, slow voice. "Always
someone hunting. Border Patrol, National Guard, INS, ICE, Minutemen. You want to
help people get where they're going out here, you need more than courage. You
need to learn how to hide."

"I'm the Coyote," he says, "And we've been hiding from each other for a long
time."

You could ask for advice, ask who he is, ask about the rabbit, or ask about
trading.

> ask about trading
You nervously ask, "Rabbit did a trade. What about you?"

The Coyote presses his hands together, still clutching the cigarette with thumb
and index finger, and smoke rises past his hidden eyes as he slowly rubs his
palms together. He mutters something rythmic to himself and you realize it's a
song, and you can't quite make out the lyrics, but the melody is simple and
makes you think of Johnny Cash and the end of the world. And then he stops, and
pulls his hands apart, and in each he holds a talent.

"Here we have luck," he says, bobbing the left, "and scent. And look, I'll be
straight with you. These are precious things and I can't afford whatever blue
light special deal the bunny gave you. I need double his price. I need two
memories to part with one of these. Oh, and they're worth it, believe me. Both
have saved my ass more times than you'd believe. Both could save yours. But it's
up to you. Which'll it be?"

You could ask about luck or ask about scent.

> i
You have a rusty can opener, a roll of duct-tape, a rusted key, a piece of jade,
a flashlight, a pack of cigarettes, your lighter, your wallet, and your
emotional baggage. You're wearing your denim jacket. You've gained the talent of
courage.

In your emotional baggage are the memories of watching Family Guy with Karl, her
graduation night, meeting Ocean, your shit job, and your grandma's stories.

You could ask about luck or ask about scent.

> trade karl for scent
The Coyote touches your fingertips and pulls watching Family Guy with Karl
through your nerve endings. "Good," he says, "I'll take that, although it's not
enough to complete the trade."

Somewhere inside you, things are shifting, moving, growing.

You could ask about luck or ask about scent.

> trade night for scent
The Coyote nods. "Yes," he says, "a fair trade." And something happens inside
you as he says it. The memory of her graduation night shifts and wriggles and
fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become something else.
And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it scent. Cool. He tucks the
other talent back in his jacket, and without its faint glow, it seems darker
than ever, the pulsing red tip of his cigarette all you can see.

"The last of us is coming," Coyote's voice says out of the black, "last and more
powerful, and most dangerous, and most afraid. Sand-dancer. Be careful of him,
Knock. Stay brave. Keep you nose to the wind. Remember the shadows."

And it seems like he's growing, larger and larger, the red tip of his cigarette
pulsing and glowing now high up in the sky, and you stumble back, shivering, and
suddenly remember your flashlight in your hand and switch it on...

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand; far above you,
a red warning light blinks on and off. A tumbleweed drifts lazily against the
rusted metal among scrawny weeds and bits of trash. Someone left a tin can here
years ago: ridged ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the glow of the
building.

> s
You walk south.

Crumbling Concrete
This concrete building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned. Tendrils of desert sand drift
against a boarded-up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk
around to the east or head south back to your truck.

> in
You wriggle through the window.

Staging Area
It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner.

The boarded-up door is southwest, alongside the empty window frame leading
outside; other rooms lie north and east.

> e
You walk east.

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall. On the opposite wall is a closed
wire mesh cage, in which is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-fashioned
emergency radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

The static on the radio resolves into overlapping whispers, which is weird
because you're damn sure you turned it off "Hey," the speaker shouts, "hey, do
you really think that the roll of duct-tape's going to help you with anything?
You can't even--" and static reclaims it again.

> n
You walk north.

Storage Room
The walls are lined with bare metal shelves, rusting away. Mounted to the wall
is a control panel for the building's emergency lights. They are switched on. On
the shelving are hundreds of cans of food, the labels long since aged away. The
break room lies back to the south and a utility ladder climbs through a broken
skylight to the roof.

> open can
You pull down a can from the shelf, grip it with the rusty can opener, and peel
open the lid. Yuck: rotten condensed milk. Not your lucky day.

> u
You climb up.

Roof
From the roof of the building, you can see the huge electrical tower rising up
in front of you. Some metal rungs once led to a control room higher up the
tower, but the lowest ones are well above your head. You'd have to jump out into
space to grab the bottom rung. A huge metal barrel stands upright and intact
nearby, large enough that you could climb up on it. At your feet is the way back
down.

> u
You pull yourself up the rungs into the control center. Hey, it wasn't that hard
after all.

Control Center
Some kind of electrical control stuff must have happened here once, but it's
totally trashed now. Like, piles of trash, broken equipment, and junk are
everywhere.

You can clearly smell gasoline coming from under that sheet of corrugated metal.

Back down is the only place to go.

> smell
Something smells strongly of gasoline.

> x metal
It seems to be harmless.

> look under metal
Your sense of smell leads you straight to a sheet of corrugated metal. You lift
it and throw it aside, revealing a gas can.

Something about the gas can makes you want to brood about road trips through the
desert.

Hey, that gas can might be useful if you decide on fixing the truck and getting
out of here.

> brood trips
Always a faint whiff of gas in your truck, even on the highway at midnight with
the windows cranked and scorching summer air sending Ocean's hair twisting and
curling behind the passenger seat. The two of you driving through the night to
visit her aunt in Santa Rosa, about a week before it happened, talking and
laughing and sometimes her hand on your leg and sometimes your hand on hers,
nothing alive but you and her and the truck and the road and the blackness
beyond.

Then all quick she leans forward at a green phantom roadsign and goes hey look,
it's the road to Nakaibito! And you have no idea what she's talking about till
you remember the story (and that you told her the story) and she says come on,
let's go, let's find out what's there. And you're like what, now? And she laughs
and says when else? And it's crazy and you tell her it's crazy, it'd be like a
four hour drive there and four hours back, totally out of your way and probably
for nothing, a couple trailers and broken glass, and you pass the exit and drive
on and tease her a little but inside you're thinking, this is why I love her (if
I do), that crazy, that what-the-hell let's do something wild and go with it
spark, that's Ocean. That's your girl. And maybe you should have done it because
now maybe your days of crazy gambling road trips are over, and maybe you'll
never find out what's in Nakaibito or anywhere else.

> take gas can
You take the gas can.

not really how it happened, was it?"

You walk west.

Staging Area
It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner.

The boarded-up door is southwest, alongside the empty window frame leading
outside; other rooms lie north and east.

> out
You start to go out, but then you stop. Something's not right. Something's...
weird. There's like this faint tickle through the soles of your feet, some
vibration, almost like whispers in the sand. You want to bend down, put your ear
to the ground, listen forever.

And then the ground drops out from under you, heaves, and drops again. Struts
groan and boards snap and then with a whooshing bang sand starts pouring in
through the window and every crack, jets of sand, and already it's shin-deep and
holy christ you've got to get out of here.

> e
You walk east.

Break Room
Waves of sand flow like water through the room, filling it higher and higher.
You glance wildly at the exits north, out, and west.

"You think just because you've got scent now you're going to be anything other
than a pathetic failure?" the radio squaks angrily, which is weird because
you're damn sure you turned it off, before dissolving into harsh buzzing
distortions.

The building shakes and groans as sand continues to pour in, rising higher and
higher.

> n
You walk north.

Storage Room
Knee-deep sand fills the room, rising at a terrifying rate. You glance wildly at
the exits south and up.

The building shakes and groans as sand continues to pour in, rising higher and
higher.

> u
Barely able to reach the ladder through sand up to your waist, you haul yourself
up the rungs and pull free just in time.

Roof
Except it's more like a foundation now, the building's sunk almost entirely into
the sand.

The sand swirls and churns like something liquid or alive around you, and then
you look and see it is alive, thousands and thousands of lizards, little sand-
dancers, are burrowing up from somewhere underground, scattering and writhing in
some complex pattern.

Then, suddenly, everything stops.

And with a mighty heave, a huge lizard crests through the sand right in front of
you.

The lizard's tongue snakes through the air, tasting it, tasting you. One slitted
eye studies you intently. It pauses, as if waiting for you to say something.

> say hello
Stunned by what you see, you stammer out a greeting.

The ground rumbles as the lizards shift. "Hello," he says and his voice shakes
the earth and creaks the rusty joins of the tower. "Yes, hello, little one.
Strange thing to say when I've always been with you, watching, waiting. But
hello, hello at last, Nakaibito."

You could ask who he is or ask about the lizards.

> ask who
"Who, uh, what are you?" you stammer.

"I am Sand-dancer," he breathes flicking his toungue in and out, slowly. "I am
the desert and the dust and the rain and the wind. I was there the first time
you went hungry and the first time you made love and the last time you asked for
help, but I could not help you then. But tonight, Nakaibito, tonight I can."

"By your actions and through your talents, you have chosen to repair your
vehicle and return to her" he says, his great slittled eye blinking. "You have
looked into yourself and found your story, the path you will walk tomorrow."

He breathes. "And are you happy with your story?" he asks, and there's some
dangerous undertone to the question and you don't know why. The lizards tense,
quivering, twisting their little heads back and forth as they await your answer.

You could say yes, say no, or say you're not sure.

> yes
You pause for a moment and realize that every insane thing that's happened
tonight has led up to this instant. You open your mouth to speak, but find that
all you can manage is a little nod.

"Yes?" Sand-dancer says, and the lizards quiver anxiously. "You're happy with
the path you've chosen? Trying to build a family out of nothing, spin futures
from goverment handouts and dusty trailer parks, raising another generation of
hopeless dropouts and messed-up losers?" The lizards scurry angrily, snapping
and clawing at each other, with a sound like static and sand.

"It doesn't matter," he says more calmly, as the lizards subside, "since you
have already made your choice. You cannot take back your actions. You cannot
unmake the past." The lizards around him tilt their heads, edge forward
cautiosly, and he seems to grin. "But I can."

The little sand-dancers writher and chitter all around you.

A glistening egg rises from the sand, glowing with neon potential, the lizard
glances down at it almost dismissively. "This is honor," he says, "the last
talent you need to achieve your goal, and you can have it for three memories.
But perhaps I have something else to trade."

The lizards whisper in anticipation as a second egg rises. This one's bigger,
and almost blinding with its intensity, and the lizards draw back, chittering in
awe and amazement. "This," Sand-dancer says, "is freedom. Pure, undiluted, and
absolute. Many crave it and few get a chance to take it. I offer it to you,
Nakaibito, but it does not come cheaply." He grins. "For freedom, you must give
up everything. You must give me all your memories."

The lizards begin to circle restlessly as they wait for you to choose. Sand-
dancer merely watches, and waits.

You could ask about honor or ask about freedom.

You have a gas can, a rusty can opener, a roll of duct-tape, a rusted key, a
piece of jade, a flashlight, a pack of cigarettes, your lighter, your wallet,
and your emotional baggage. You're wearing your denim jacket. You've gained the
talents courage and scent.

In your emotional baggage are the memories of road trips through the desert,
meeting Ocean, your shit job, and your grandma's stories.

You could ask about honor or ask about freedom.

> trade trips for honor
He flicks out his tongue and pulls road trips through the desert from your core,
swallowing it whole. "A good start," he says, "but you must trade more."

You could ask about honor or ask about freedom.

> trade shit job for honor
He flicks out his tongue and pulls your shit job from your head, swallowing it
whole. "Yes," he says, "but more."

You could ask about honor or ask about freedom.

> trade stories for honor
Sand-dancer nods. "Yes," he says, "a fair trade." And something happens inside
you as he says it. The memory of your grandma's stories shifts and wriggles and
fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become something else.
And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it honor. Cool. "The choice is
made," he rumbles, "your path is set. Goodbye, Nakaibito." And he turns and
dives into the sand. The lizards twist and writhe and follow him.

And then, just as quiet settles, another huge rumble shakes the ground, and,
almost like an afterthought, the building breaches the sand and rises to the
surface.

Crumbling Concrete
This concrete building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned. Tendrils of desert sand drift
against a boarded-up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk
around to the east or head south back to your truck.

> s
You go, and the clouds are gone and the stars are so bright you squint. You
patch the fuel line and refill the tank and she starts like a beauty, and then
you're back on the highway again, headed for Ocean, the urge to breathe the same
air as her leads you like a bloodhound.

You shut off the headlights as you pull up to the trailer, and climb in through
her window for old times sake, crazy courage her sister at least appreciated if
not her old man. She's awake of course, always no matter how quiet you are, and
she holds out a hand from somewhere under the blankets. And as she's doing it
you're suddenly exhausted, beyond exhausted but also safe, warm even before you
slip under the covers. She half turns to kiss you as you fumble with the
blankets but you're so tired all you can do is push your face against her neck
and slip an arm around her warm skin, and she starts to ask you something but
it's too late, you're crashing, you're crashing, you crash...

     *** You have honor. ***

Would you like to:
     UNDO the last move,
     RESTORE a saved position,
     QUIT the program,
     or RESTART from the beginning?

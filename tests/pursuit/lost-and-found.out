Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all your dimming headlights
pick out before barely reaching the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; wiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air. On the dash you
can see a piece of jade. The glove compartment is closed.

> exit
You work the rusty truck door open. You get out of the pickup truck.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Pursuit should occur soon.

You walk south.

Backtracking
It's quieter and darker over here, the black desert night bleed in. Your tire
track are hardly visible in the desert sand, and you can barely make out the way
north back to your truck.

You walk north.

Crumbling Concrete
This building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned. Tendrils of desert sand drift
against a boarded-up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk
around to the east or head south back to your truck.

Out of the corner of your eye you spot a glimpse of something moving in the
darkness, off in the desert to the west.

You head off in the direction of movement, scanning with your flashlight over
the skittering shadows.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and every inch of sand looks just like
every other.

Half-lost in the shadows, you see a looming cactus, some dry bones, and some
clumps of sagebrush and that's about it.

Hey, there it is again--something's moving to the northeast.

> s
You lose sight of whatever it was.

You walk south.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and you shiver in the chill
night air.

Nearby: a looming cactus, some dry bones, and a dead cow. Nothing to write home
about.

Open Desert
Your tracks are swallowed up in moments by the billowing sand, and you plod
wearily through the sand.

Half-lost in the shadows, you see a dull grey boulder, some clumps of sagebrush,
and some dry bones and that's about it.

You walk south.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and you wish you could see more than
twenty feet in front of you.

All you can make out in the darkness are a dry streambed, a looming cactus, and
some clumps of sagebrush.

The dust storm rages around you, and you shiver in the chill night air.

Half-lost in the shadows, you see a dead cow, a dry streambed, and a low bluff

It's gone now... no, wait--a darting shadow to the southwest.

You chase after the shadow, faster and faster, breath misting in the cold air.

Yeah, you're sure you saw it--something's moving to the northwest.

Some crazy thrill comes over you. You feel like a hunter. You can almost smell
the thing you're chasing in the air. You can smell it, fur and terror. You race
after it.

Dodging after the fleeing, skittering shadow, you're almost caught up to it when
your foot trips on a rock and you stumble to the ground. But the ground doesn't
stop your fall, it collapses, and you're tumbling in a shower of dirt clods down
a hole, rolling down some crazy underground tunnel clutching at mud and roots,
till finally you slide into some damp, fetid place, and come up a stop against
something soft, huge, warm. And furry.

You are here.

Middle of Nowhere
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all your dimming headlights
pick out before barely reaching the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; wiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air. On the dash you
can see a piece of jade.

> n
You walk north.

Crumbling Concrete
This building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned: fragments of glass sparkle faintly
in the beam of your headlights. Tendrils of desert sand drift against a boarded-
up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk around to the east
or head south back to your truck.

> in
(first attempting to open the pane of cracked glass inside)
It looks like these windows have been rusted shut for years.

> attack door
The door won't budge. You slam your hands against the boards in frustration,
causing the nearby window to quiver in the reflected light.

> enter door
The door won't budge. You slam your hands against the boards in frustration,
causing the nearby window to quiver in the reflected light.

> attack window
Nice thought, but the last thing you need is a sliced open hand. Perhaps you
could get a little distance.

> open window
It looks like these windows have been rusted shut for years.

> x window
The glass is too filthy to see anything on the other side.

> throw wallet at window
The wallet passes through the pane of cracked glass, shattering it.

> open window
It's already busted open.

> close window
There's nothing of the pane of cracked glass left to close.

> x window
The pane of cracked glass is open, and through it you can see someplace
unfamiliar.

> in
You walk in through the pane of cracked glass.

Staging Area
Faint shafts of light from your dimming headlights seep through the broken
window leading outside, but you can barely make out anything of the interior.

> out
You walk out through the pane of cracked glass.

> s
You take a step and crack your shin against what feels like a metal desk.

> n
You take a step and crack your shin against what feels like a metal desk.

> feel desk
You feel around the edge of the desk, and find that it has a drawer.

> open drawer
You slide the drawer open by feel in the darkness. Something large and lumpy
rolls around inside--a flashlight?

> take flashlight
Yeah, it's a flashlight all right. You grip it in sudden relief, turning it in
your hands until your fingers find the switch.

> turn it on
Your surroundings spring into brightness around you.
Staging Area
It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner, revealing a hole criss-crossed with cobwebs.

You can squeeze through the broken window to the outside. Other rooms lie north
and east.

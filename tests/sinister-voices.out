but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall. On the opposite wall is a closed
flimsy-looking wire mesh cage, in which is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-
fashioned emergency radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

The emergency radio is already off.

The cold night air swirls around you, and you pull your jacket closer.

Hey, that emergency blanket might be useful if you decide on spending the night
here.

You walk north.

Storage Room
The walls are lined with bare metal shelves, rusting away. Mounted to the wall
is a control panel for the building's emergency lights. They are switched on. On
the shelving are hundreds of cans of food, the labels long since aged away. The
break room lies back to the south and a utility ladder climbs through a broken
skylight to the roof.

With a sudden growl of static, the radio springs to life, which is weird because
you're damn sure you turned it off and it freaks the hell out of you. The voice
weaves in and out of crazy whirling distortion and shifting blasts of static.
"Hey... receiving? ...never told... you'll never, never--" A wail like an 8-bit
banshee screams through the signal. "...waste of time... who do you think? ..."
Static, static. "Very soon now, Nak... akaibito... very..."

Uh. You're pretty sure you never told that dude your name. Maybe you're just
hearing things.

Staging Area
It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner, revealing a hole criss-crossed with cobwebs.

The boarded-up door is southwest, alongside the empty window frame leading
outside; other rooms lie north and east.

Open doorways lead west and north.

The radio growls to life again, the voice distorted now under a constant barrage
of electronic rain. "Where do you think you're going?" it says. "What are you
trying to do? You can't..." A snap, some syncopated crackles. "... can see you,
Na... know where.... never going to work. Never g--" And the voice cuts off,
replaced by a low, tooth-rattling hum.

The voice sounds different than before. I mean it still kind of sounds like the
first guy you talked to but it sounds like someone else now too, someone you
know, you've known for a long time. Someone you're afraid of.

Vintage, man. A chrome switch on the side to turn it on and off, and a big
fifties dial on the front. It's lit up from inside ... are those freakin' vacuum
tubes?

You slam a fist into the top of the radio, but it just keeps hissing with
static.

The static on the radio resolves into overlapping whispers. "It makes for a nice
story," the whispers say, "but you're remembering your shit job all wrong.
That's not really how it happened, was it?"

You smash the radio over and over again, until it lies in pieces on the ground,
but the static still continues, and more and more it sounds like sand.

"You think just because you've got strength now you're going to be anything

"You're nothing," the radio spews, "your strength and scent are worthless.
You'll never amount to anything, and neither will your kid, just another half-
breed loser destined to die in poverty and live in debt, isn't that right,
Knock?" and with a sudden shock you realize why the voice sounds so familiar.
It's your voice. It's your own god-damned voice.

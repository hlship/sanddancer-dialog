Middle of Nowhere
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all your dimming headlights
pick out before barely reaching the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; wiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air.

Outside the wavering glow of your headlights, it's black. Pitch. Storm must have
rolled in; there's no stars above, no anything but blackness around. Only the
smell of the desert tells you it's still out there.

You walk south.

Backtracking
It's quieter and darker over here, the black desert night bleed in. Your tire
track are hardly visible in the desert sand, and you can barely make out the way
north back to your truck.

> s
You stare back down the pickup's path uneasily. The tracks are swallowed by
darkness, quickly melding, blending, and vanishing into a maze of ATV tracks,
coyote trails, rocky outcrops, and shadows. You squint at the horizon. There's
no distant sweep of headlights, no sound of trucks shifting through lonely
gears. Nothing. Nothing at all. You're way off the road, and there's no chance
at all of finding it again in this demon dark.

Crumbling Concrete
This building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned: fragments of glass sparkle faintly
in the beam of your headlights. Tendrils of sand spill through the empty
doorframe leading in to a dark interior; you could also walk around to the east
or head south back to your truck.

You walk north.

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand, on of three
legs of the huge electrical tower looming like some gargantuan spider into
blackness above you A tumbleweed drifts lazily against the rusted metal among
scrawny weeds bits of trash. Someone left a tin can here years ago: ridged
ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the building.

You walk southeast.

Weed Strewn Rust
Behind the rather small building is nothing but a scraggly patch of yellowing
weeds and dirt near a leaking pipe, littered by a collection of rusted barrels
and some scattered newspapers. Atop one overturned barrel is a weathered
guidebook.

Desert stretches in all directions; back west is the front of the building.

> x guidebook
Most of the pages are faded or worn away, but flipping through, it looks like a
guide to local animal life. You could try looking up various animals in it.

Staging Area
Faint shafts of light from your dimming headlights seep through a boarded-up
pane of cracked glass, but you can barely make out anything of the interior.

You take a step and crack your shin against what feels like a metal desk.

You take a step and crack your shin against what feels like a metal desk.

> feel desk
You feel around the edge of the desk, and find that it has a drawer.

> open it
You slide the drawer open by feel in the darkness. Something large and lumpy
rolls around inside--a flashlight?

> take light
Yeah, it's a flashlight all right. You grip it in sudden relief, turning it in
your hands until your fingers find the switch.

> turn light on
Your surroundings spring into brightness around you.
Staging Area
It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner, revealing a hole criss-crossed with cobwebs.

In a pane of cracked glass you catch a momentary reflection of yourself.

Other rooms lie north and east.

> x hole
Through a mass of cobwebs, you can see a roll of duct-tape down in the whole.

> take tape
You reach your hand towards the hole, then pull back with a start as you brush
cobwebs. Nightmare visions of fat black spiders shudder through your brain. No
way are you reaching in there.

> n
You walk north.

Foreman's Office
You sweep the beam of your flashlight around this tiny office, probably once
where the boss sat under a dust covered window. A half collapsed desk sits
against a wall. On the half-collapsed desk is a rusted key.

The only exit is to the south.

> x desk
It seems to be harmless.

You walk south.

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall, and a closed wire cage, in which is
an emergency blanket.

Open doorways lead west and north.

> open cage
The wire mesh cage is locked.

> n
You walk north.

Storage Room
The walls are lined with bare metal shelves, casting strange patterns of shadow
as you sweep your flashlight beam around. Mounted to the wall is a control panel
for the building's emergency lights. They are switched off. Rows of crumbling
shelving support hundreds of cans of food, the labels long since aged away. The
break room lies back to the south and a utility ladder climbs through a broken
skylight to the roof.

> turn on lights
With a sharp buzz, a wiff of static, and an electrical groan, bare light bulbs
flicker on throughout the building.

Roof
From the roof of the building, you can see the huge electrical tower rising up
in front of you. Some metal rungs once led to a control room higher up the
tower, but the lowest ones are well above your head. You'd have to jump out into
space to grab the bottom rung. A huge metal barrel stands upright and intact
nearby, large enough that you could climb up on it. At your feet is the way back
down.

> n
It's a drop off on all sides.

> climb barrel
Yeah, you could get on top of it, but while it's over here, you couldn't reach a
whole lot.

> u
The metal rungs have rusted away and crumbled; the lowest are well above your
head. You don't have the courage to make the jump.

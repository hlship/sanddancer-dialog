but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Control Center
Some kind of electrical control stuff must have happened here once, but it's
totally trashed now. Like, piles of trash, broken equipment, and junk are
everywhere. But hey, on one pile there's a somewhat serviceable can opener.

You catch a faint whiff of gasoline coming from somewhere.

Back down is the only place to go.

> smell
Something smells very faintly of gasoline.

Your sense of smell leads you straight to a sheet of corrugated metal. You lift
it effortlessly, allowing you to reach inside and pull out a small plastic gas
can. The contents of the can slosh around... you guess there's enough gas there
to get you home, if you can patch up the truck.

Something about the gas can makes you want to brood about road trips through the
desert.

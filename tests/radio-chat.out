but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Foreman's Office
The stark emergency lights illume this tiny office, probably once where the boss
sat under a dust covered window. A half collapsed desk sits against a wall. On
the half-collapsed desk is a rusted key. Tacked to the wall is a peeling safety
poster.

The only exit is to the south.

You walk south.

Staging Area
It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner, revealing a hole criss-crossed with cobwebs.

The boarded-up door is southwest, alongside the empty window frame leading
outside; other rooms lie north and east.

You walk east.

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall. On the opposite wall is a closed
wire mesh cage, in which is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-fashioned
emergency radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

Hey, that emergency blanket might be useful if you decide on spending the night
here.

> turn on radio
With a hiss and a crackle, the old radio comes to life.

> tune it to 107 khz
You tune the emergency radio to 107.0 khz.

> tune it to 104
You tune the emergency radio to 104.0 khz.

> listen to radio
Hiss and crackle.

> tune it to 102.3 khz
You tune the emergency radio to 102.3 khz.

Not like you think anything's going to happen, but what the hell. You grab the
dusty old mike, press the call button, and ask "Is there anybody out there?"

The speaker blurts and holy crap, someone's responding, and they say "Roger,
roger, tower station nineteen, read you now loud and clear, what's your forty?"
and the voice is staticky and whirled through with weird rythmic distortions but
you can hear it just fine and now what?

You could ask what ten forty means, say never mind, or say that you are lost.

> listen to radio
You mean, beyond the conversation you're in the middle of? No, nothing stands
out.

You could ask what ten forty means, say never mind, or say that you are lost.

> lost
Feeling a little stupid, you come clean and tell the voice that you drove off
the road and aren't sure really exactly where you are.

"Copy that," the voice says briskly after a moment. "You're at tower station
nineteen, son, about thirty-two miles southwest of Oro Oeste, fifteen miles or
so from the state highway." And if the mike wasn't attached to the radio you'd
drop it on the floor. Fifteen miles? How in the hell could you have driven
fifteen miles off the road and not remember? How is that even possible?

"Hello?" the radio says. "Hello son, do you copy?"

You could answer yes or turn off the radio.

> yes
You jabber something positive and sit back, still shaken.

"Look, son," the voice says, "I don't know how you got out there but that's not
important right now. Weather report's coming in and there's a cold front the
size of Texas coming your way. I don't want to scare you but if you don't find a
way home, or figure out some food and shelter for the night, you could freeze to
death. You hear me? Now on account of the cutbacks I don't have anyone to send
out there until morning. But there may be parts around that old tower you can
use to patch up your truck and make it back to the highway. Or, there may be
emergency supplies that would get you through the night. This storm's gonna blow
out all our communication, so you're gonna be on your own. It's up to you. Over
and out."

You rub your face tiredly. Ocean was expecting you tonight after your shift,
like usual. If you don't make it she'll be worried sick. Then on the other hand
maybe you should worry about yourself first for a change. You feel like you need
a cigarette and then you remember you quit. Hell, can't anything be easy?

> n
You walk north.

Storage Room
The walls are lined with bare metal shelves, rusting away. Mounted to the wall
is a control panel for the building's emergency lights. They are switched on.
Rows of crumbling shelving support hundreds of cans of food, the labels long
since aged away. The break room lies back to the south and a utility ladder
climbs through a broken skylight to the roof.

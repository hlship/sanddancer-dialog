Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all your dimming headlights
pick out before barely reaching the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; wiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air. On the dash you
can see a piece of jade. The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Query succeeded: (setup coyotes offer)
> (now) (knock holds #courage)
> open glove compartment
You open the glove compartment, revealing a pack of cigarettes.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

It's over. They've caught you. They surround you, circling, growling, looking
for weakness, moving in for the kill.

> take pack
You take the pack of cigarettes out of the glove compartment.

> teleport open desert

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and every inch of sand looks
just like every other.

Half-lost in the shadows, you see a looming cactus, a dull grey boulder, and
some clumps of sagebrush and that's about it.

> z
Nah, man, better keep busy or else it's back to brooding about your grandma's
stories.

The circle of snarling coyotes tightens.

> attack coyotes
It's over. The coyotes dive in for the kill, jaws snapping, and suddenly this
bolt of courage runs through you and without even thinking about it you leap
towards the biggest coyote with a terrible scream.

It flinches back, suddenly unsure, and you charge at it full speed, still
screaming, arms outstretched, until it turns tail and bolts away. The other
coyotes circle uncertainly, but you turn your snarling furious rage on them too
and then they're all scattering, mangy shadows slinking away into the desert.
Except for one last coyote who stands his ground.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

> say yes
It's freezing out and your nerves are jangled. "Sure, I could use a smoke" you
say.

You pull out your pack and he grins, like he knew you'd say yes, and leans
forward for you to light up off him. His sunglasses reflect back nothing but
your own face weirdly lit by the glow from the cig, and for a moment it's like
the blackness behind them is deep, deeper than the sky, deeper than the
universe...

A moment passes.

"Gotta keep an eye on the horizon," he says in a scratchy, slow voice. "Always
someone hunting. Border Patrol, National Guard, INS, ICE, Minutemen. You want to
help people get where they're going out here, you need more than courage. You
need to learn how to hide."

"I'm the Coyote," he says, "And we've been hiding from each other for a long
time."

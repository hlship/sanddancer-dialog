but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Query succeeded: (setup coyotes offer)
> (now) (knock holds #courage)
> open glove compartment
You open the glove compartment, revealing a pack of cigarettes.

Something about the sage makes you want to brood about watching Family Guy with
Karl.

You stop in mid-stride as your eyes flick to the horizon. Way out in the desert,
silhouetted on a rise, a distant figure stands. As you watch he raises a hand
and waves.

> take pack
You take the pack of cigarettes out of the glove compartment.

> exit
The door creaks open with difficulty, rusted joints straining. You get out of
the pickup truck.

You walk west for a long time, thoughts turning over like the sand under your
sneakers. You think about meeting Ocean. You think about Ocean and how pissed
she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to wait up for you
but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking
up you can't see a damn thing. You can't see your pickup, you can't see the
electrical tower. Not even your damn footprints. You're lost. Well, shit.

Open Desert
The dust storm rages around you, and every inch of sand looks just like every
other.

You can sort of see a dead cow, a dull grey boulder, and a looming cactus.

Something snarls off in the distance, a warning growl.

You move nervously forward.

Open Desert
Your tracks are swallowed up in moments by the billowing sand, and you wish you
could see more than twenty feet in front of you.

All you can make out in the darkness are a dull grey boulder, a looming cactus,
and a low bluff.

It's over. They've caught you. They surround you, circling, growling, looking
for weakness, moving in for the kill.

> attack coyotes
It's over. The coyotes dive in for the kill, jaws snapping, and suddenly this
bolt of courage runs through you and without even thinking about it you leap
towards the biggest coyote with a terrible scream.

It flinches back, suddenly unsure, and you charge at it full speed, still
screaming, arms outstretched, until it turns tail and bolts away. The other
coyotes circle uncertainly, but you turn your snarling furious rage on them too
and then they're all scattering, mangy shadows slinking away into the desert.
Except for one last coyote who stands his ground.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

> say yes
It's freezing out and your nerves are jangled. "Sure, I could use a smoke" you
say.

You pull out your pack and he grins, like he knew you'd say yes, and leans
forward for you to light up off him. His sunglasses reflect back nothing but
your own face weirdly lit by the glow from the cig, and for a moment it's like
the blackness behind them is deep, deeper than the sky, deeper than the
universe...

The coyote stares at you momentarily before gazing out at the horizon.
"Gotta keep an eye on the horizon," he says in a scratchy, slow voice. "Always
someone hunting. Border Patrol, National Guard, INS, ICE, Minutemen. You want to
help people get where they're going out here, you need more than courage. You
need to learn how to hide."

"I'm the Coyote," he says, "And we've been hiding from each other for a long
time."

You could ask for advice, ask who he is, ask about the rabbit, or ask about
trading.

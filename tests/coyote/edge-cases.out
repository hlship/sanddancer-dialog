Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all your dimming headlights
pick out before barely reaching the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; wiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air. On the dash you
can see a piece of jade. The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Open Desert
The dust storm rages around you, and god damn it's dark.

Nearby: some dry bones, a dry streambed, and a low bluff. Nothing to write home
about.

> z
Nah, man, better keep busy or else it's back to brooding about your grandma's
stories.

It's over. They've caught you. They surround you, circling, growling, looking
for weakness, moving in for the kill.

> attack coyotes
It's over. The coyotes dive in for the kill, jaws snapping,, mangy shadows
slinking away into the desert. Except for one last coyote who stands his ground.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and you plod wearily through
the sand.

All you can make out in the darkness are some dry bones, a dry streambed, and a
low bluff.

The Coyote watches you intently.

You could say yes or say no.

> x coyote
You can barely see him in the darkness, can't tell whether he's old or how old,
what color his faded denim jacket is, and with those sunglasses on, you can't
even tell whether he's smirking at you or just twitching his mouth. There's a
weird smell coming off him, sweat and dirt and a little wet dog and something
deeper, earther, desert, rain, all mixed with cigarette smoke.

You could say yes or say no.

> turn flashlight on
You think you'd rather keep him on your side.

You could say yes or say no.

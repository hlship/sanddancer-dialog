but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

(first attempting to get out of the pickup truck)
The door creaks open with difficulty, rusted joints straining. You get out of
the pickup truck.

Something about the sage makes you want to brood about watching Family Guy with
Karl.

You stop in mid-stride as your eyes flick to the horizon. Way out in the desert,
silhouetted on a rise, a distant figure stands. As you watch he raises a hand
and waves.

You walk west for a long time, thoughts turning over like the sand under your
sneakers. You think about your shit job. You think about Ocean and how pissed
she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to wait up for you
but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking
up you can't see a damn thing. You can't see your pickup, you can't see the
electrical tower. Not even your damn footprints. You're lost. Well, shit.

Open Desert
Your tracks are swallowed up in moments by the billowing sand, and you wish you
could see more than twenty feet in front of you.

Nearby: a stand of cactus, a dull grey boulder, and a looming cactus. Nothing to
write home about.

Something snarls off in the distance, a warning growl.

You move nervously forward.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and god damn it's dark.

All you can make out in the darkness are a dry stream-bed, a dull grey boulder,
and some dry bones.

It's over. They've caught you. They surround you, circling, growling, looking
for weakness, moving in for the kill.

> attack coyotes
It's over. The coyotes dive in for the kill, jaws snapping,, mangy shadows
slinking away into the desert. Except for one last coyote who stands his ground.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and you wish you could see more than
twenty feet in front of you.

You can sort of see a dry stream-bed, a dull grey boulder, and some dry bones.

The Coyote watches you intently.

You could say yes or say no.

> x coyote
You can barely see him in the darkness, can't tell whether he's old or how old,
what color his faded denim jacket is, and with those sunglasses on, you can't
even tell whether he's smirking at you or just twitching his mouth. There's a
weird smell coming off him, sweat and dirt and a little wet dog and something
deeper, earth, desert, rain, all mixed with cigarette smoke.

You could say yes or say no.

> turn flashlight on
You think you'd rather keep him on your side.

You could say yes or say no.

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all your dimming headlights
pick out before barely reaching the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; wiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air. On the dash you
can see a piece of jade. The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Open Desert
Your tracks are swallowed up in moments by the billowing sand, and you shiver in
the chill night air.

All you can make out in the darkness are a looming cactus, a stand of cactus,
and some dry bones.

> z
Nah, man, better keep busy or else it's back to brooding about when you heard
the news.

It's over. They've caught you. They surround you, circling, growling, looking
for weakness, moving in for the kill.

> attack coyotes
It's over. The coyotes dive in for the kill, jaws snapping, and without hardly
realizing what you're doing you make a fist and slam it into the one that's
closest.

The coyote squeals, flung sideways by the strength of your punch, blood dripping
from its nose, and the rest of the pack pulls back in sudden caution. Another
coyote makes to lunge and you whirl towards it in fury, pulling back for another
blow, but the pack breaks in some collective decision and scatters, mangy
shadows slinking away into the desert. Except for one last coyote who stands his
ground.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

> no
"Nah, I'm trying to kick 'em" you say.

He shugs, takes a puff on his, and exhales the smoke into the desert night. Wind
whips it away and he stares towards the horizon, forehead wrinkling in something
(annoyance, maybe contemplation) you can't read through the sunglasses.

A moment passes.

"Gotta keep an eye on the horizon," he says in a scratchy, slow voice. "Always
someone hunting. Border Patrol, National Guard, INS, ICE, Minutemen. You want to
help people get where they're going out here, you need more than strength. You
need to learn how to hide."

"I'm the Coyote," he says, "And we've been hiding from each other for a long
time."

but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and you plod wearily through
the sand.

You can sort of see a low bluff, some clumps of sagebrush, and a looming cactus.

> attack coyotes
It's over. The coyotes dive in for the kill, jaws snapping, and suddenly this
bolt of courage runs through you and without even thinking about it you leap
towards the biggest coyote with a terrible scream.

It flinches back, suddenly unsure, and you charge at it full speed, still
screaming, arms outstretched, until it turns tail and bolts away. The other
coyotes circle uncertainly, but you turn your snarling furious rage on them too
and then they're all scattering, mangy shadows slinking away into the desert.
Except for one last coyote who stands his ground.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

You take the piece of jade.

Something about the sage makes you want to brood about watching Family Guy with
Karl.

You stop in mid-stride as your eyes flick to the horizon. Way out in the desert,
silhouetted on a rise, a distant figure stands. As you watch he raises a hand
and waves.

(first attempting to get out of the pickup truck)
The door creaks open with difficulty, rusted joints straining. You get out of
the pickup truck.

You walk north.

Crumbling Concrete
This concrete building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned. Tendrils of desert sand drift
against a boarded-up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk
around to the east or head south back to your truck.

You walk west for a long time, thoughts turning over like the sand under your
sneakers. You think about your shit job. You think about Ocean and how pissed
she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to wait up for you
but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking
up you can't see a damn thing. You can't see your pickup, you can't see the
electrical tower. Not even your damn footprints. You're lost. Well, shit.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and every inch of sand looks just like
every other.

Half-lost in the shadows, you see a stand of cactus, a low bluff, and some dry
bones and that's about it.

Something snarls off in the distance, a warning growl.

You move nervously forward.

Open Desert
Your tracks are swallowed up in moments by the billowing sand, and you shiver in
the chill night air.

You can sort of see some clumps of sagebrush, a looming cactus, and a dull grey
boulder.

A howl from behind you, and an answer from somewhere ahead. Coyotes. Hungry,
sounds like.

> (now) (turns in current room 6)
> w
You jog forward, eyes snapping left and right at the moving shadows around you.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and you wish you could see
more than twenty feet in front of you.

Nearby: a stand of cactus, a dry stream-bed, and a looming cactus. Nothing to
write home about.

It's over. They've caught you. They surround you, circling, growling, looking
for weakness, moving in for the kill.

You try to flee and instantly teeth and claws block your path; you pull back to
the center of the circle, terrified.

The coyotes growl, pulling closer, snapping at your heels.

The circle of snarling coyotes tightens.

A coyote snaps his teeth, lunging forward, then fading back into the pack.

Nah, man, better keep busy or else it's back to brooding about meeting Ocean.

The coyotes growl, pulling closer, snapping at your heels.

It's over. The coyotes dive in for the kill, jaws snapping, and you cower in
fear.

But then one of them flicks his head and bares his teeth, and the others pull
back. He's not bigger or stronger or anything, but there's something about him
that's different. He takes the littlest step forward and the others scatter,
mangy shadows slinking away into the desert and then you're left alone with the
leader, the alpha coyote.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

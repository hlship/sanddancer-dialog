but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Query succeeded: (setup coyotes offer)
> take jade
You take the piece of jade.

Something about the sage makes you want to brood about watching Family Guy with
Karl.

You stop in mid-stride as your eyes flick to the horizon. Way out in the desert,
silhouetted on a rise, a distant figure stands. As you watch he raises a hand
and waves.

(first attempting to get out of the pickup truck)
The door creaks open with difficulty, rusted joints straining. You get out of
the pickup truck.

You walk west for a long time, thoughts turning over like the sand under your
sneakers. You think about meeting Ocean. You think about Ocean and how pissed
she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to wait up for you
but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking
up you can't see a damn thing. You can't see your pickup, you can't see the
electrical tower. Not even your damn footprints. You're lost. Well, shit.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and god damn it's dark.

Half-lost in the shadows, you see a looming cactus, a stand of cactus, and a
dull grey boulder and that's about it.

Something snarls off in the distance, a warning growl.

> (now) (turns in current room 6)

You move nervously forward.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and every inch of sand looks just like
every other.

Nearby: a stand of cactus, some clumps of sagebrush, and a low bluff. Nothing to
write home about.

It's over. They've caught you. They surround you, circling, growling, looking
for weakness, moving in for the kill.

> brood stories
No time for that now.

The coyotes growl, pulling closer, snapping at your heels.

> x coyotes
They're all around you, teeth and fur and sweat and muscles, angry, closing.

The circle of snarling coyotes tightens.

> s
You try to flee and instantly teeth and claws block your path; you pull back to
the center of the circle, terrified.

A coyote snaps his teeth, lunging foward, then fading back into the pack.

> throw jade at coyotes
Maybe you could just attack them directly.

The coyotes growl, pulling closer, snapping at your heels.

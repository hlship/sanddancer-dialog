but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

> take jade
You take the piece of jade.

Open Desert
The dust storm rages around you, and every inch of sand looks just like every
other.

Half-lost in the shadows, you see a stand of cactus, a dull grey boulder, and a
low bluff and that's about it.

> x coyotes
They're all around you, teeth and fur and sweat and muscles, angry, closing.

A coyote snaps his teeth, lunging forward, then fading back into the pack.

> brood stories
No time for that now.

The coyotes growl, pulling closer, snapping at your heels.

It's over. The coyotes dive in for the kill, jaws snapping, and you cower in
fear.

But then one of them flicks his head and bares his teeth, and the others pull
back. He's not bigger or stronger or anything, but there's something about him
that's different. He takes the littlest step forward and the others scatter,
mangy shadows slinking away into the desert and then you're left alone with the
leader, the alpha coyote.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

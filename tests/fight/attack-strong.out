but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and you plod wearily through the sand.

Nearby: a low bluff, some clumps of sagebrush, and some dry bones. Nothing to
write home about.

> attack coyotes
It's over. The coyotes dive in for the kill, jaws snapping, and without hardly
realizing what you're doing you make a fist and slam it into the one that's
closest.

The coyote squeals, flung sideways by the strength of your punch, blood dripping
from its nose, and the rest of the pack pulls back in sudden caution. Another
coyote makes to lunge and you whirl towards it in fury, pulling back for another
blow, but the pack breaks in some collective decision and scatters, mangy
shadows slinking away into the desert. Except for one last coyote who stands his
ground.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

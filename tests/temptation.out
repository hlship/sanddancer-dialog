but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

You take the piece of jade.

> brood stories
There are dark spirits who roam the earth, little Knock. Grandma used to say
that, holding you tight and stroking your hair. There are dark spirits who roam
the earth, but you're not alone. Oh, no. I'm here. (She'd kiss your head and
you'd squeeze her back.) But others are watching out for you too. You have three
animal guardians, hmm? Spirits who are always watching over you. Oh, you can't
always trust them to know what's best. Remember that, Knock. But when you need
help, they'll come, and protect you from the worser things in the world.

Mom would yell at Grandma a lot for filling your head with that new-age
bullshit. Grandma grew up white and midwestern and Baptist, but had started
wearing things with feathers and playing the pan flute by the time you were
born. She seemed to really like having a son-in-law who was Native American or
American Indian or Indigenous People or whatever she'd decided the term was that
week, and she was pretty pissed when Mom left him. Anyway. Her stories were
mostly BS, you guess, but some of them stuck with you. When it's dark you still
wonder if your spirit animals are out there, somewhere, and what the hell is
taking them so long to find you.

> teleport burrow

Burrow
Roots push through the earthen roof, casting weird shadows in the beam of your
flashlight. It's round and small and underground in here and filled with hot
sweat and animal stench. But mostly filled with something big and alive.

It's huge, covered in sweaty fur stained with mud, and a huge eye stares out you
above long black whiskers. You can feel its breath on your face and its
heartbeat thudding through the floor and you cringe back in terror against the
wall. It'sâ€¦ well.

It's a rabbit.

> x rabbit
The closer you look the weirder it gets, like it doesn't start or end in any one
place or something all new-agey like that.

The cold night air swirls around you, and you pull your jacket closer.

The rabbit breaths and stares. You wonder if it's going to start talking like in
some crap disney movie and then jesus christ it does...

"So, what'd you expect from an animal guardian?" it says, but like not with its
lips, somewhere in your head instead. "Were you thinking big, nasty, sharp,
pointy teeth? Waistcoat and pocket watch? Nah. Tricks are for kids. What's up,
Knock?" Its whiskers twitch.

You could ask who he is or just, you know, go insane.

> go insane
I know, right? Looks like it's too late though.

You could ask who he is.

> ask who
"Who, uh, what are you?" you ask.

"Oh come on, pal, you know me," he says with this kind of stupid cheerful tone,
and suddenly he looks more like Buster from Arthur, scrawny and poorly animated.
"I've been keeping an eye on you from the TV all these years. Your grandma asked
me to, remember?" He grins, buck teeth protruding.

You could ask about grandma's stories or say he's not real.

> ask real
(I only understood you as far as wanting to ask someone something.)

> tell real
"But, you're not, like, real."

"Oh, don't say that!" the rabbit says, animated eyes going round like saucers.
"Then it'd be just you here all alone, and wouldn't that be boring. It's much
more interesting if I'm really around."

The rabbit stares intently at you, as if expecting something.

"Hey, yo, you been hella good about keepin' off those cancer sticks," Buster
says, except he's not Buster any more, more like Eminem. "Don't think I ain't
watchin' ya." (Oh hey, Rabbit Smith, you get it.)

You could ask how he knows so much about everything.

> ask much
"I don't understand," you ask "how you know so much about me. Grandma.
Everything."

"Hey, back off man," he says, "it's my ***n' job." And there's actually like a
bleep, too, and now that you think of it you only ever saw 8 Mile on TV.

The rabbit's ears twitch a little, and he looks momentarily anxious.

"Anyway, look, man, we both know you're in trouble. I just gotta ask you one
question." And he changes again into like a giant silhouette, and it's the
Playboy Bunny, ears and bow tie and all. "Do you love her?"

You could say that you don't know, answer yes, or answer no.

> no
"I tell her I love her," you begin, "because I know she needs me to say it. But
really, deep down, I know it shouldn't be because of her. It should be because
of me, and that's just not there. Not yet. Maybe not ever."

Something about the bunny's bow tie makes you want to brood about her graduation
night.

"Then what are you still doing with her?" the bunny says. "Get out while the
gettings good. You think either of you will be happier if you put that off?
There's fish in other oceans kid. You've got your whole life to swim." It winks.

The rabbit twitches a little and looks at you expectantly.

"Look," he says, and now he's big and fluffy and smells like springtime and
peeps. "I can help you make your decisions. I'll trade you for one of these
talents." He holds out an easter basket filled with plastic green easter grass;
in it are two glowing orbs.

"Strength," hey says, pointing to the first one, "and courage. Pick whichever
one you think will be most useful, but you have to give me something back.
Something real, something I can work with."

You could ask about strength, ask about courage, ask about trading, or say you
don't want to trade.

> trade stories for strength
The Rabbit nods. "Yes," he says, "a fair trade." And something happens inside
you as he says it. The memory of your grandma's stories shifts and wriggles and
fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become something else.
And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it strength. Cool.

"The others are coming," he says, "they'll be here soon," and now he looks like
Frank from Donnie Darko and his face is behind that freaky metal mask and his
voice is distorted and makes your skin crawl.

"Watch out for them," he says. "We all want to help, but... the others are
wilier than me. Look up."

"Look up, Naki," he says again.

> i
You have a piece of jade, a flashlight, your lighter, your wallet, and your
emotional baggage. You're wearing your denim jacket. You've gained the talent of
strength.

In your emotional baggage are the memories of her graduation night and meeting
Ocean.

> look up
Stupidly, you tilt your head back and stare up at the dirt ceiling, and all you
can see is blackness.

No wait... there's patterns, slowly shifting, barely visible in the darkness,
and miles away. Like clouds. And then a drop of water falls on your face, and
then another, and you realize suddenly you're outside, and it's starting to
rain...

Backtracking
It's quieter and darker over here, the black desert night bleeding in. Your tire
tracks are hardly visible in the desert sand, and you can barely make out the
way north back to your truck.

Rain starts to come down, pattering on the desert sand. Soon it's gonna be a
muddy deathtrap out here.

> teleport break room

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall. On the opposite wall is a closed
flimsy-looking wire mesh cage, in which is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-
fashioned emergency radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

With a sudden growl of static, the radio springs to life, which is weird because
you're damn sure you turned it off and it freaks the hell out of you. The voice
weaves in and out of crazy whirling distortion and shifting blasts of static.
"Hey... receiving? ...never told... you'll never, never--" A wail like an 8-bit
banshee screams through the signal. "...waste of time... who do you think? ..."
Static, static. "Very soon now, Nak... akaibito... very..."

Uh. You're pretty sure you never told that dude your name. Maybe you're just
hearing things.

> attack cage
You grip the mesh in one hand and pull, and realize it's so rusted you can
easily peel it back. The door rips free and you drop it to the floor.

Hey, that emergency blanket might be useful if you decide on spending the night
here.

Rain batters down on the desert.

> take blanket
You take the emergency blanket out of the flimsy-looking wire mesh cage.

Rain batters down on the desert.

> teleport control center

Control Center
Some kind of electrical control stuff must have happened here once, but it's
totally trashed now. Like, piles of trash, broken equipment, and junk are
everywhere. But hey, on one pile there's a somewhat serviceable can opener.

You catch a faint whiff of gasoline coming from somewhere.

Back down is the only place to go.

> teleport crumbling concrete

Crumbling Concrete
This concrete building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned. Tendrils of desert sand drift
against a boarded-up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk
around to the east or head south back to your truck.

Nah, man, better keep busy or else it's back to brooding about meeting Ocean.

The rain's dying down, the sounds of the storm fading, water sinking into the
thirsty sand leaving only the smell of sage behind.

You stop in mid-stride as your eyes flick to the horizon. Way out in the desert,
silhouetted on a rise, a distant figure stands. As you watch he raises a hand
and waves.

> smell
The soaking rain has brought out the smell of sage throughout the desert. When
you were a kid, it smelt like camping and adventure. Now it just smells like
desert and confusion.

Something about the sage makes you want to brood about watching Family Guy with
Karl.

> wave
The figure waves back, then seems to beckon you forward.

> attack figure
He's too far away. You can barely see him.

> w
You walk west for a long time, thoughts turning over like the sand under your
sneakers. You think about meeting Ocean. You think about Ocean and how pissed
she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to wait up for you
but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking
up you can't see a damn thing. You can't see your pickup, you can't see the
electrical tower. Not even your damn footprints. You're lost. Well, shit.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and every inch of sand looks
just like every other.

All you can make out in the darkness are a low bluff, a dry streambed, and a
dead cow.

Something snarls off in the distance, a warning growl.

> z
Nah, man, better keep busy or else it's back to brooding about her graduation
night.

A howl from behind you, and an answer from somewhere ahead. Coyotes. Hungry,
sounds like.

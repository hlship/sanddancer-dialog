but it's too late, you're crashing, you crash...

Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

You open the glove compartment, revealing a pack of cigarettes.

> get pack
You take the pack of cigarettes out of the glove compartment.

> x pack
You're trying to quit, but man, you could really go for one right now. It looks
like you've only got six left.

> smoke pack
You pull out a cigarette and flick it into life. Thoughts tumble through your
head.

Well, you're stuck here. It's dark outside the beam of your headlights. Well,
you could start by getting out of this truck.

And you still haven't quit smoking. You toss the the butt out the window of the
truck and wonder what to do next.

> x pack

The door creaks open with difficulty, rusted joints straining. You get out of
the pickup truck.

> light cigs
You pull out a cigarette and flick it into life. Thoughts tumble through your
head.

Well, you're stuck here. It's dark outside the beam of your headlights. Maybe
you could start by looking around, see if there's a phone or something.

And you still haven't quit smoking. You crush the butt under your heel and
wonder what to do next.

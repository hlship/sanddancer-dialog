Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all your dimming headlights
pick out before barely reaching the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; wiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air. On the dash you
can see a piece of jade. The glove compartment is closed.

You have your lighter, your wallet, and your emotional baggage. You're wearing
your denim jacket.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

In your emotional baggage is your grandma's stories.

You open your wallet, revealing your driver's license, a receipt from Big
Jimmy's, and a folded photo.

Something about the receipt from Big Jimmy's makes you want to brood about your
shit job.

Juza straddles the 371 like a drunk at last call, smelly and without a plan for
the future. Shiny cars whiz by at ninety once in a while, only stopping for gas
or directions (hint: not this way). No one ever stops for the stalls selling
food and jewelry and blankets and cheap t-shirts that cluster around the dirt
turn-off onto the rez. At least, no one buying anything.

Big Jimmy shook his head when he heard you lived in Oro Oeste. Hell of a drive,
kid, he said, popping up his Lumberjacks cap to scratch the straw pate
underneath. You should get a place in Hoo-zuh. Little Jimmy'll set you up in
that trailer cross the road for almost nothin'.

Almost nothing. Yeah, exactly what you'd turn into on the cold day in hell you
move to Juza. But on the other hand, that was before you met Ocean. Now the road
back to Oro Oeste seems longer and longer every night.

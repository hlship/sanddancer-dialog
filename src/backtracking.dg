(look *)
    It's quieter and darker over here, the black desert night bleeding in.
    Your tire tracks are hardly visible in the desert sand, and you can barely make
    out the way north back to your truck.

        You stare back down the pickup's path uneasily.
        The tracks are swallowed by darkness, quickly melding, blending,
        and vanishing into a maze of ATV tracks, coyote trails,
        rocky outcrops, and shadows.
        You squint at the horizon.
        There's no distant sweep of headlights, no sound of trucks shifting
        through lonely gears.
        Nothing. Nothing at all. 
    (or)
    (stopping)
    You're way off the road, and there's no chance at all of finding it again in
    this demon dark.

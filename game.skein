Middle of Nowhere (in the pickup truck)
You've smashed up against a tall Saguaro, which is all you can see out the
windshield except a few feet of desert sand, then blackness. Hell, you must have
driven off the road and crashed. Ocean keeps telling you this night commute on
this lonely highway's gonna kill you; maybe you should start listening.

On the dash you can see a piece of jade.

The glove compartment is closed.

Through the windshield, you see a little lizard clinging frantically to the
Saguaro.

Something about the piece of jade makes you want to brood about your grandma's
stories.

There are dark spirits who roam the earth, little Knock. Grandma used to say
that, holding you tight and stroking your hair. There are dark spirits who roam
the earth, but you're not alone. Oh, no. I'm here. (She'd kiss your head and
you'd squeeze her back.) But others are watching out for you too. You have three
animal guardians, hmm? Spirits who are always watching over you. Oh, you can't
always trust them to know what's best. Remember that, Knock. But when you need
help, they'll come, and protect you from the worser things in the world.

Mom would yell at Grandma a lot for filling your head with that new-age
bullshit. Grandma grew up white and midwestern and Baptist, but had started
wearing things with feathers and playing the pan flute by the time you were
born. She seemed to really like having a son-in-law who was Native American or
American Indian or Indigenous People or whatever she'd decided the term was that
week, and she was pretty pissed when Mom left him. Anyway. Her stories were
mostly BS, you guess, but some of them stuck with you. When it's dark you still
wonder if your spirit animals are out there, somewhere, and what the hell is
taking them so long to find you.

Juza straddles the 371 like a drunk at last call, smelly and without a plan for
the future. Shiny cars whiz by at ninety once in a while, only stopping for gas
or directions (hint: not this way). No one ever stops for the stalls selling
food and jewelry and blankets and cheap t-shirts that cluster around the dirt
turn-off onto the rez. At least, no one buying anything.

Big Jimmy shook his head when he heard you lived in Oro Oeste. Hell of a drive,
kid, he said, popping up his Lumberjacks cap to scratch the straw pate
underneath. You should get a place in Hoo-zuh. Little Jimmy'll set you up in
that trailer cross the road for almost nothin'.

Almost nothing. Yeah, exactly what you'd turn into on the cold day in hell you
move to Juza. But on the other hand, that was before you met Ocean. Now the road
back to Oro Oeste seems longer and longer every night.

Crumbling Concrete
This concrete building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge
electrical tower to the north, now abandoned: a pane of cracked glass sparkles
faintly in the beam of your headlights. Tendrils of desert sand drift against a
boarded-up door to the northeast leading inside; you could also walk around to

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand, one of three
legs of the huge electrical tower looming like some gargantuan spider into
blackness above you. A tumbleweed drifts lazily against the rusted metal among
scrawny weeds and bits of trash. Someone left a tin can here years ago: ridged
ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the building.

Something about the tumbleweed makes you want to brood about your last day of
high school.

Staging Area
It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner, revealing a hole criss-crossed with cobwebs.

The boarded-up door is southwest, alongside the empty window frame leading
outside; other rooms lie north and east.

Foreman's Office
You sweep the beam of your flashlight around this tiny office, probably once
where the boss sat under a dust covered window. A half collapsed desk sits
against a wall. On the half-collapsed desk is a rusted key. Tacked to the wall
is a peeling safety poster.

The only exit is to the south.

She was buying a Fresca at Big Jimmy's when you got off your shift, shoving work
keys in your pocket, and you stood behind her waiting to get some cigs, almost
too tired to notice how cute she was but still noticing, yeah, still noticing.

She turned around and caught you noticing and you were pretty embarrassed and
covered in sweat and grease from the garage, so you stepped up and bought some
Camels and were pretty surprised that she was still there when you turned
around.

She told you her name was Ocean Running Deer and she lived on the rez and you
told her your name was Nakaibito Morales and you lived in Oro Oeste. She said
isn't Nakaibito the name of a town off west and you told her your mom had picked
it off a map because it sounded like a good Indian name. You never tell anyone
that story but for some reason you told her. She laughed, sweetly though, and
said maybe the two of you should go there sometime and see what is was like.
Somehow two weeks later you were dating although you never ended up going to
Nakaibito.

And now... no, you can't think about that yet.

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall. On the opposite wall is a locked
wire cage. In the cage is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-fashioned emergency
radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

back to the south and a utility ladder climbs through a broken skylight to the

You tune the emergency radio to 102.3 khz.

Not like you think anything's going to happen, but what the hell. You grab the
dusty old mike, press the call button, and ask "Is there anybody out there?"

The speaker blurts and holy crap, someone's responding, and they say "Roger,
roger, tower station nineteen, read you now loud and clear, what's your forty?"
and the voice is staticky and whirled through with weird rhythmic distortions
but you can hear it just fine and now what?

You could ask what forty means, say never mind, or say that you are lost.

Feeling a little stupid, you come clean and tell the voice that you drove off
the road and aren't sure really exactly where you are.

"Copy that," the voice says briskly after a moment. "You're at tower station
nineteen, son, about thirty-two miles southwest of Oro Oeste, fifteen miles or
so from the state highway." And if the mike wasn't attached to the radio you'd
drop it on the floor. Fifteen miles? How in the hell could you have driven
fifteen miles off the road and not remember? How is that even possible?

"Hello?" the radio says. "Hello son, do you copy?"

You could answer yes or turn off the radio.

You jabber something positive and sit back, still shaken.

"Look, son," the voice says, "I don't know how you got out there but that's not
important right now. Weather report's coming in and there's a cold front the
size of Texas coming your way. I don't want to scare you but if you don't find a
way home, or figure out some food and shelter for the night, you could freeze to
death. You hear me? Now on account of the cutbacks I don't have anyone to send
out there until morning. But there may be parts around that old tower you can
use to patch up your truck and make it back to the highway. Or, there may be
emergency supplies that would get you through the night. This storm's gonna blow
out all our communication, so you're gonna be on your own. It's up to you. Over
and out."

You rub your face tiredly. Ocean was expecting you tonight after your shift,
like usual. If you don't make it she'll be worried sick. Then on the other hand
maybe you should worry about yourself first for a change. You feel like you need
a cigarette and then you remember you quit. Hell, can't anything be easy?

nearby, large enough that you could climb up on it. At your feet is the way back

You head off in the direction of movement, scanning with your flashlight over
the skittering shadows.

You walk east for a long time, thoughts turning over like the sand under your
sneakers. You think about meeting Ocean. You think about Ocean and how pissed
she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to wait up for you
but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking
up you can't see a damn thing. You can't see your pickup, you can't see the
electrical tower. Not even your damn footprints. You're lost. Well, shit.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and you plod wearily through the sand.

Half-lost in the shadows, you see a dull grey boulder, a stand of cactus, and a
low bluff and that's about it.

Dodging after the fleeing, skittering shadow, you're almost caught up to it when
your foot trips on a rock and you stumble to the ground. But the ground doesn't
stop your fall, it collapses, and you're tumbling in a shower of dirt clods down
a hole, rolling down some crazy underground tunnel clutching at mud and roots,
till finally you slide into some damp, fetid place, and come up a stop against
something soft, huge, warm. And furry.

Burrow
Roots push through the earthen roof, casting weird shadows in the beam of your
flashlight. It's round and small and underground in here and filled with hot
sweat and animal stench. But mostly filled with something big and alive.

It's huge, covered in sweaty fur stained with mud, and a huge eye stares out you
above long black whiskers. You can feel its breath on your face and its
heartbeat thudding through the floor and you cringe back in terror against the
wall. It's… well.

It's a rabbit.

The rabbit breaths and stares. You wonder if it's going to start talking like in
some crap disney movie and then jesus christ it does...

"So, what'd you expect from an animal guardian?" it says, but like not with its
lips, somewhere in your head instead. "Were you thinking big, nasty, sharp,
pointy teeth? Waistcoat and pocket watch? Nah. Tricks are for kids. What's up,
Knock?" Its whiskers twitch.

"Oh come on, pal, you know me," he says with this kind of stupid cheerful tone,
and suddenly he looks more like Buster from Arthur, scrawny and poorly animated.
"I've been keeping an eye on you from the TV all these years. Your grandma asked
me to, remember?" He grins, buck teeth protruding.

You could ask about grandma's stories or say he's not real.

"Then it'd be just you here all alone, and wouldn't that be boring. It's much
more interesting if I'm really around."

The rabbit twitches a little and looks at you expectantly.

"Yo, you started smokin' again?" Buster asks, sniffing disdainfully, except he's
not Buster any more, more like Eminem. "I thought you quit that shit, dawg. It's
cool, I won't tell your grandma, but it makes Thumper cry a little, you know
what I'm sayin'?" (Oh hey, Rabbit Smith, you get it.)

"Hey, back off man," he says, "it's my ***n' job." And there's actually like a
bleep, too, and now that you think of it you only ever saw 8 Mile on TV.

The rabbit stares intently at you, as if expecting something.

"Anyway, look, man, we both know you're in trouble. I just gotta ask you one
question." And he changes again into like a giant silhouette, and it's the
Playboy Bunny, ears and bow tie and all. "Do you love her?"

You could say that you don't know, answer yes, or answer no.

Something about the bunny's bow tie makes you want to brood about her graduation
night.

"Then you probably should get home and tell her," the bunny says. "Patch up that
truck and fly down the highway before she gets away." It winks.

The rabbit twitches a little and looks at you expectantly.

"Look," he says, and now he's big and fluffy and smells like springtime and
peeps. "I can help you make your decisions. I'll trade you for one of these
talents." He holds out an easter basket filled with plastic green easter grass;
in it are two glowing orbs.

"Strength," he says, pointing to the first one, "and courage. Pick whichever one
you think will be most useful, but you have to give me something back. Something
real, something I can work with."

You could ask about strength, ask about courage, ask about trading, or say you
don't want to trade.

In your emotional baggage are the memories of her graduation night, meeting

you as he says it. The memory of your last day of high school shifts and
wriggles and fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become
something else. And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it courage.
Cool.

"The others are coming," he says, "they'll be here soon," and now he looks like
Frank from Donnie Darko and his face is behind that freaky metal mask and his
voice is distorted and makes your skin crawl.

"Watch out for them," he says. "We all want to help, but... the others are
wilier than me. Look up."

then another, and you realize suddenly you're outside, and it's starting to
rain...

Backtracking
It's quieter and darker over here, the black desert night bleeding in. Your tire
tracks are hardly visible in the desert sand, and you can barely make out the
way north back to your truck.

The cold night air swirls around you, and you pull your jacket closer.

Rain starts to come down, pattering on the desert sand. Soon it's gonna be a

And that was maybe you think the first time she said she loved you, and you said

It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner, revealing a hole criss-crossed with cobwebs.

The boarded-up door is southwest, alongside the empty window frame leading

wire cage. In the cage is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-fashioned emergency
radio hums and crackles on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

With a sudden growl of static, the radio springs to life and it freaks the hell
out of you. The voice weaves in and out of crazy whirling distortion and
shifting blasts of static. "Hey... receiving? ...never told... you'll never,

It flinches back, suddenly unsure, and you charge at it full speed, still
screaming, arms outstretched, until it turns tail and bolts away. The other
coyotes circle uncertainly, but you turn your snarling furious rage on them too
and then they're all scattering, mangy shadows slinking away into the desert.
Except for one last coyote who stands his ground.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

forward for you to light up off him. His sunglasses reflect back nothing but
your own face weirdly lit by the glow from the cig, and for a moment it's like
the blackness behind them is deep, deeper than the sky, deeper than the
universe...

The coyote stares at you momentarily before gazing out at the horizon.
"Gotta keep an eye on the horizon," he says in a scratchy, slow voice. "Always
someone hunting. Border Patrol, National Guard, INS, ICE, Minutemen. You want to
help people get where they're going out here, you need more than courage. You
need to learn how to hide."

"I'm the Coyote," he says, "And we've been hiding from each other for a long
time."

trading.

"Just getting to that," he replies. He then presses his hands together, still
clutching the cigarette with thumb and index finger, and smoke rises past his
hidden eyes as he slowly rubs his palms together. He mutters something rhythmic
to himself and you realize it's a song, and you can't quite make out the lyrics,
but the melody is simple and makes you think of Johnny Cash and the end of the
world. And then he stops, and pulls his hands apart, and in each he holds a
talent.

"Here we have luck," he says, bobbing the left, "and scent. And look, I'll be
straight with you. These are precious things and I can't afford whatever blue
light special deal the bunny gave you. I need double his price. I need two
memories to part with one of these. Oh, and they're worth it, believe me. Both
have saved my ass more times than you'd believe. Both could save yours. But it's

You have a rusty can opener, a roll of duct-tape, a rusted key, a piece of jade,
a flashlight, a pack of cigarettes, your lighter, your wallet, and your
emotional baggage. You're wearing your denim jacket. You've gained the talent of
courage.

In your emotional baggage are the memories of when you heard the news, watching
Family Guy with Karl, her graduation night, meeting Ocean, your shit job, and
your grandma's stories.

The Coyote touches your fingertips and pulls the memory of watching Family Guy
with Karl through your nerve endings. "Good," he says, "I'll take that, although
it's not enough to complete the trade."

Somewhere inside you, things are shifting, moving, growing.

You could ask about luck or ask about scent.

The Coyote nods. "Yes," he says, "a fair trade." And something happens inside
you as he says it. The memory of her graduation night shifts and wriggles and
fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become something else.
And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it scent. Cool. He tucks the
other talent back in his jacket, and without its faint glow, it seems darker
than ever, the pulsing red tip of his cigarette all you can see.

"The last of us is coming," Coyote's voice says out of the black, "last and most
powerful, and most dangerous, and most afraid. Sand-dancer. Be careful of him,
Knock. Stay brave. Keep your nose to the wind. Remember the shadows."

And it seems like he's growing, larger and larger, the red tip of his cigarette
pulsing and glowing now high up in the sky, and you stumble back, shivering, and
suddenly remember your flashlight in your hand and switch it on...

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand; far above you,
a red warning light blinks on and off. A tumbleweed drifts lazily against the
rusted metal among scrawny weeds and bits of trash. Someone left a tin can here
years ago: ridged ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the glow of the
building.

It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of

collapsed near one corner.

The boarded-up door is southwest, alongside the empty window frame leading

scent.

You've found the roll of duct-tape, but you still need something else if you
plan on fixing the truck and getting out of here. Seems like you should try to
sniff out that gas now.

And that was your last cigarette. You crush the butt under your heel and wonder

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall. On the opposite wall is a locked
wire cage. In the cage is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-fashioned emergency
radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

The static on the radio resolves into overlapping whispers, which is weird
because you're damn sure you turned it off. "Hey," the speaker shouts, "hey, do
you really think that a roll of duct-tape's going to help you with anything? You
can't even--" and static reclaims it again.

Something about the gas can makes you want to brood about road trips through the

Always a faint whiff of gas in your truck, even on the highway at midnight with
the windows cranked and scorching summer air sending Ocean's hair twisting and
curling behind the passenger seat. The two of you driving through the night to
visit her aunt in Santa Rosa, about a week before it happened, talking and
laughing and sometimes her hand on your leg and sometimes your hand on hers,
nothing alive but you and her and the truck and the road and the blackness
beyond.

Then all quick she leans forward at a green phantom roadsign and goes hey look,
it's the road to Nakaibito! And you have no idea what she's talking about till
you remember the story (and that you told her the story) and she says come on,
let's go, let's find out what's there. And you're like what, now? And she laughs
and says when else? And it's crazy and you tell her it's crazy, it'd be like a
four hour drive there and four hours back, totally out of your way and probably
for nothing, a couple trailers and broken glass, and you pass the exit and drive
on and tease her a little but inside you're thinking, this is why I love her (if
I do), that crazy, that what-the-hell let's do something wild and go with it
spark, that's Ocean. That's your girl. And maybe you should have done it because
now maybe your days of crazy gambling road trips are over, and maybe you'll

And then the ground drops out from under you, heaves, and drops again. Struts
groan and boards snap and then with a whooshing bang sand starts pouring in

Except it's more like a foundation now, the building's sunk almost entirely into
the sand.

The sand swirls and churns like something liquid or alive around you, and then
you look and see it is alive, thousands and thousands of lizards, little sand-
dancers, are burrowing up from somewhere underground, scattering and writhing in
some complex pattern.

Then, suddenly, everything stops.

And with a mighty heave, a huge lizard crests through the sand right in front of
you.

The lizard's tongue snakes through the air, tasting it, tasting you. One slitted
eye studies you intently. It pauses, as if waiting for you to say something.

You could say hello.

you went hungry and the first time you made love and the last time you asked for
help, but I could not help you then. But tonight, Nakaibito, tonight I can."

"By your actions and through your talents, you have chosen to repair your
vehicle and return to her" he says, his great slittled eye blinking. "You have
looked into yourself and found your story, the path you will walk tomorrow."

He breathes. "And are you happy with your story?" he asks, and there's some
dangerous undertone to the question and you don't know why. The lizards tense,
quivering, twisting their little heads back and forth as they await your answer.

You could say yes, say no, or say you're not sure.

You pause for a moment and realize that every insane thing that's happened
tonight has led up to this instant. You open your mouth to speak, but find that
all you can manage is a little nod.

"Yes?" Sand-dancer says, and the lizards quiver anxiously. "You're happy with
the path you've chosen? Trying to build a family out of nothing, spin futures
from government handouts and dusty trailer parks, raising another generation of
hopeless dropouts and messed-up losers?" The lizards scurry angrily, snapping
and clawing at each other, with a sound like static and sand.

"It doesn't matter," he says more calmly, as the lizards subside, "since you
have already made your choice. You cannot take back your actions. You cannot
unmake the past." The lizards around him tilt their heads, edge forward
cautiously, and he seems to grin. "But I can."

The little sand-dancers writher and chitter all around you.

A glistening egg rises from the sand, glowing with neon potential, the lizard
glances down at it almost dismissively. "This is honor," he says, "the last
talent you need to achieve your goal, and you can have it for three memories.
But perhaps I have something else to trade."

The lizards whisper in anticipation as a second egg rises. This one's bigger,
and almost blinding with its intensity, and the lizards draw back, chittering in
awe and amazement. "This," Sand-dancer says, "is freedom. Pure, undiluted, and
absolute. Many crave it and few get a chance to take it. I offer it to you,
Nakaibito, but it does not come cheaply." He grins. "For freedom, you must give
up everything. You must give me all your memories."

The lizards begin to circle restlessly as they wait for you to choose. Sand-
dancer merely watches, and waits.

You could ask about honor or ask about freedom.

You shut off the headlights as you pull up to the trailer, and climb in through

food and jewelry and blankets and cheap t-shirts that cluster around the dirt
turn-off onto the rez. At least, no one buying anything.

Big Jimmy shook his head when he heard you lived in Oro Oeste. Hell of a drive,

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny
frosted window. Some rotting picnic tables strewn with layers of sand and
crumbling trash are pushed against one wall. On the opposite wall is a locked
wire cage. In the cage is an emergency blanket. A clunky old-fashioned emergency
radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

There are dark spirits who roam the earth, little Knock. Grandma used to say
that, holding you tight and stroking your hair. There are dark spirits who roam
the earth, but you're not alone. Oh, no. I'm here. (She'd kiss your head and
you'd squeeze her back.) But others are watching out for you too. You have three
animal guardians, hmm? Spirits who are always watching over you. Oh, you can't
always trust them to know what's best. Remember that, Knock. But when you need
help, they'll come, and protect you from the worser things in the world.

Mom would yell at Grandma a lot for filling your head with that new-age
bullshit. Grandma grew up white and midwestern and Baptist, but had started
wearing things with feathers and playing the pan flute by the time you were
born. She seemed to really like having a son-in-law who was Native American or
American Indian or Indigenous People or whatever she'd decided the term was that
week, and she was pretty pissed when Mom left him. Anyway. Her stories were
mostly BS, you guess, but some of them stuck with you. When it's dark you still
wonder if your spirit animals are out there, somewhere, and what the hell is
taking them so long to find you.

(first attempting to get out of the pickup truck)
The door creaks open with difficulty, rusted joints straining. You get out of
the pickup truck.

Something about the sage makes you want to brood about watching Family Guy with
Karl.

You stop in mid-stride as your eyes flick to the horizon. South-east of you, out
in the desert, silhouetted on a rise, a distant figure stands. As you watch he
raises a hand and waves.

You walk east for a long time, thoughts turning over like the sand under your
sneakers. You think about your shit job. You think about Ocean and how pissed
she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to wait up for you
but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking
up you can't see a damn thing. You can't see your pickup, you can't see the
electrical tower. Not even your damn footprints. You're lost. Well, shit.

Open Desert
The desert stretches around you in all directions, and you wish you could see
more than twenty feet in front of you.

Half-lost in the shadows, you see a dull grey boulder, a low bluff, and some dry
bones and that's about it.

food and jewelry and blankets and cheap t-shirts that cluster around the dirt
turn-off onto the rez. At least, no one buying anything.

Big Jimmy shook his head when he heard you lived in Oro Oeste. Hell of a drive,

There are dark spirits who roam the earth, little Knock. Grandma used to say
that, holding you tight and stroking your hair. There are dark spirits who roam
the earth, but you're not alone. Oh, no. I'm here. (She'd kiss your head and
you'd squeeze her back.) But others are watching out for you too. You have three
animal guardians, hmm? Spirits who are always watching over you. Oh, you can't
always trust them to know what's best. Remember that, Knock. But when you need
help, they'll come, and protect you from the worser things in the world.

Mom would yell at Grandma a lot for filling your head with that new-age
bullshit. Grandma grew up white and midwestern and Baptist, but had started
wearing things with feathers and playing the pan flute by the time you were
born. She seemed to really like having a son-in-law who was Native American or
American Indian or Indigenous People or whatever she'd decided the term was that
week, and she was pretty pissed when Mom left him. Anyway. Her stories were
mostly BS, you guess, but some of them stuck with you. When it's dark you still
wonder if your spirit animals are out there, somewhere, and what the hell is
taking them so long to find you.

"Oh, don't say that!" the rabbit says, animated eyes going round like saucers.
"Then it'd be just you here all alone, and wouldn't that be boring. It's much
more interesting if I'm really around."

The rabbit stares intently at you, as if expecting something.

"Hey, yo, you been hella good about keepin' off those cancer sticks," Buster
says, except he's not Buster any more, more like Eminem. "Don't think I ain't
watchin' ya." (Oh hey, Rabbit Smith, you get it.)

You could ask how he knows so much about everything.

"I don't understand," you ask "how you know so much about me. Grandma.
Everything."

"Hey, back off man," he says, "it's my ***n' job." And there's actually like a
bleep, too, and now that you think of it you only ever saw 8 Mile on TV.

The rabbit twitches a little and looks at you expectantly.

"Anyway, look, man, we both know you're in trouble. I just gotta ask you one
question." And he changes again into like a giant silhouette, and it's the
Playboy Bunny, ears and bow tie and all. "Do you love her?"

You could say that you don't know, answer yes, or answer no.

"I tell her I love her," you begin, "because I know she needs me to say it. But
really, deep down, I know it shouldn't be because of her. It should be because
of me, and that's just not there. Not yet. Maybe not ever."

Something about the bunny's bow tie makes you want to brood about her graduation
night.

"Then what are you still doing with her?" the bunny says. "Get out while the
gettings good. You think either of you will be happier if you put that off?
There's fish in other oceans kid. You've got your whole life to swim." It winks.

The rabbit stares intently at you, as if expecting something.

"Look," he says, and now he's big and fluffy and smells like springtime and
peeps. "I can help you make your decisions. I'll trade you for one of these
talents." He holds out an easter basket filled with plastic green easter grass;
in it are two glowing orbs.

"Strength," he says, pointing to the first one, "and courage. Pick whichever one
you think will be most useful, but you have to give me something back. Something
real, something I can work with."

You could ask about strength, ask about courage, ask about trading, or say you
don't want to trade.

you as he says it. The memory of your grandma's stories shifts and wriggles and
fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become something else.
And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it strength. Cool.

"The others are coming," he says, "they'll be here soon," and now he looks like
Frank from Donnie Darko and his face is behind that freaky metal mask and his
voice is distorted and makes your skin crawl.

"Watch out for them," he says. "We all want to help, but... the others are
wilier than me. Look up."

then another, and you realize suddenly you're outside, and it's starting to
rain...

Backtracking
It's quieter and darker over here, the black desert night bleeding in. Your tire
tracks are hardly visible in the desert sand, and you can barely make out the
way north back to your truck.

Rain starts to come down, pattering on the desert sand. Soon it's gonna be a

Foreman's Office
The stark emergency lights illume this tiny office, probably once where the boss
sat under a dust covered window. A half collapsed desk sits against a wall. On
the half-collapsed desk is a rusted key. Tacked to the wall is a peeling safety
poster.

The only exit is to the south.

Not like you think anything's going to happen, but what the hell. You grab the

The speaker blurts and holy crap, someone's responding, and they say "Roger,
roger, tower station nineteen, read you now loud and clear, what's your forty?"
and the voice is staticky and whirled through with weird rhythmic distortions
but you can hear it just fine and now what?

Feeling a little stupid, you come clean and tell the voice that you drove off
the road and aren't sure really exactly where you are.

"Copy that," the voice says briskly after a moment. "You're at tower station
nineteen, son, about thirty-two miles southwest of Oro Oeste, fifteen miles or
so from the state highway." And if the mike wasn't attached to the radio you'd
drop it on the floor. Fifteen miles? How in the hell could you have driven
fifteen miles off the road and not remember? How is that even possible?

"Hello?" the radio says. "Hello son, do you copy?"

important right now. Weather report's coming in and there's a cold front the
size of Texas coming your way. I don't want to scare you but if you don't find a
way home, or figure out some food and shelter for the night, you could freeze to
death. You hear me? Now on account of the cutbacks I don't have anyone to send
out there until morning. But there may be parts around that old tower you can
use to patch up your truck and make it back to the highway. Or, there may be
emergency supplies that would get you through the night. This storm's gonna blow
out all our communication, so you're gonna be on your own. It's up to you. Over
and out."

You rub your face tiredly. Ocean was expecting you tonight after your shift,
like usual. If you don't make it she'll be worried sick. Then on the other hand
maybe you should worry about yourself first for a change. You feel like you need
a cigarette and then you remember you quit. Hell, can't anything be easy?

Open doorways lead west and north.

"You're nothing," the radio spews, "your strength and scent are worthless.
You'll never amount to anything, and neither will your kid, just another half-
breed loser destined to die in poverty and live in debt, isn't that right,
Knock?" and with a sudden shock you realize why the voice sounds so familiar.
It's your voice. It's your own god-damned voice.

Staging Area
It's obvious this place has been abandoned for years. Cold night air breathes
through holes in the roof and everything is strewn with sand and patches of
mold. An imposing metal desk extends out from one wall. The floor has half-
collapsed near one corner, revealing a hole criss-crossed with cobwebs.

The boarded-up door is southwest, alongside the empty window frame leading
outside; other rooms lie north and east.

Break Room
Shadows and grime linger in dark corners of this dismal room with just one tiny

wire cage. In the cage is an emergency blanket. The remains of the smashed
emergency radio are scattered across the floor.

Open doorways lead west and north.

The radio fizzles and growls through weird twists of distortion.

Water from the storm trickles down from unseen cracks and holes.

There are dark spirits who roam the earth, little Knock. Grandma used to say
that, holding you tight and stroking your hair. There are dark spirits who roam
the earth, but you're not alone. Oh, no. I'm here. (She'd kiss your head and
you'd squeeze her back.) But others are watching out for you too. You have three
animal guardians, hmm? Spirits who are always watching over you. Oh, you can't
always trust them to know what's best. Remember that, Knock. But when you need
help, they'll come, and protect you from the worser things in the world.

Mom would yell at Grandma a lot for filling your head with that new-age
bullshit. Grandma grew up white and midwestern and Baptist, but had started
wearing things with feathers and playing the pan flute by the time you were
born. She seemed to really like having a son-in-law who was Native American or
American Indian or Indigenous People or whatever she'd decided the term was that
week, and she was pretty pissed when Mom left him. Anyway. Her stories were
mostly BS, you guess, but some of them stuck with you. When it's dark you still
wonder if your spirit animals are out there, somewhere, and what the hell is
taking them so long to find you.

Burrow
Roots push through the earthen roof, casting weird shadows in the beam of your
flashlight. It's round and small and underground in here and filled with hot
sweat and animal stench. But mostly filled with something big and alive.

It's huge, covered in sweaty fur stained with mud, and a huge eye stares out you
above long black whiskers. You can feel its breath on your face and its
heartbeat thudding through the floor and you cringe back in terror against the
wall. It's… well.

It's a rabbit.

The rabbit breaths and stares. You wonder if it's going to start talking like in
some crap disney movie and then jesus christ it does...

"So, what'd you expect from an animal guardian?" it says, but like not with its
lips, somewhere in your head instead. "Were you thinking big, nasty, sharp,
pointy teeth? Waistcoat and pocket watch? Nah. Tricks are for kids. What's up,
Knock?" Its whiskers twitch.

The rabbit stares intently at you, as if expecting something.

"Hey, yo, you been hella good about keepin' off those cancer sticks," Buster
says, except he's not Buster any more, more like Eminem. "Don't think I ain't

The rabbit's ears twitch a little, and he looks momentarily anxious.

"Anyway, look, man, we both know you're in trouble. I just gotta ask you one
question." And he changes again into like a giant silhouette, and it's the
Playboy Bunny, ears and bow tie and all. "Do you love her?"

really, deep down, I know it shouldn't be because of her. It should be because
of me, and that's just not there. Not yet. Maybe not ever."

Something about the bunny's bow tie makes you want to brood about her graduation
night.

"Then what are you still doing with her?" the bunny says. "Get out while the
gettings good. You think either of you will be happier if you put that off?
There's fish in other oceans kid. You've got your whole life to swim." It winks.

The rabbit twitches a little and looks at you expectantly.

"Look," he says, and now he's big and fluffy and smells like springtime and
peeps. "I can help you make your decisions. I'll trade you for one of these
talents." He holds out an easter basket filled with plastic green easter grass;
in it are two glowing orbs.

"Strength," he says, pointing to the first one, "and courage. Pick whichever one
you think will be most useful, but you have to give me something back. Something
real, something I can work with."

You could ask about strength, ask about courage, ask about trading, or say you
don't want to trade.

you as he says it. The memory of your grandma's stories shifts and wriggles and
fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become something else.
And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it strength. Cool.

"The others are coming," he says, "they'll be here soon," and now he looks like
Frank from Donnie Darko and his face is behind that freaky metal mask and his
voice is distorted and makes your skin crawl.

"Watch out for them," he says. "We all want to help, but... the others are
wilier than me. Look up."

"Look up, Naki," he says again.

Backtracking
It's quieter and darker over here, the black desert night bleeding in. Your tire
tracks are hardly visible in the desert sand, and you can barely make out the

radio sits on a table.

Open doorways lead west and north.

With a sudden growl of static, the radio springs to life, which is weird because
you're damn sure you turned it off and it freaks the hell out of you. The voice
weaves in and out of crazy whirling distortion and shifting blasts of static.
"Hey... receiving? ...never told... you'll never, never--" A wail like an 8-bit

and how pissed she's gonna be that you're not home. Like you tell her not to
wait up for you but she always does anyway.

Some wind kicks up and chucks sand in your face. You blink it out and kinda
realize while you're doing it that you haven't really been paying attention to
where you've been going. Another gust whines through the sagebrush and you
realize with a kind of heavy feeling that with all the dust this wind is kicking

But then one of them flicks his head and bares his teeth, and the others pull

that's different. He takes the littlest step forward and the others scatter,
mangy shadows slinking away into the desert and then you're left alone with the
leader, the alpha coyote.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that

your own face weirdly lit by the glow from the cig, and for a moment it's like
the blackness behind them is deep, deeper than the sky, deeper than the

The coyote stares at you momentarily before gazing out at the horizon.

"You know who I am," he says, the red tip of the cigarette glowing as he takes
another drag. "I'm the one who runs on both sides of the fence. I'm the one who
scouts ahead. I'm the one with songs in my blood and dirt under my nails and
people owe me money in every trailer park town from here to Yuma, or maybe I owe
them money but anyway they don't want to see me. You know who I am, Knock."

"Are you like the rabbit?" you ask.

He grins, not unkindly but not exactly kindly either. "That cute little
jackalope?" he says, itching underneath his jacket, slowly. "He's got his
upsides, I guess. has its place. But if you're always in the spotlight, you'll
never learn how to live in the shadows. And most of us spend a lot of time in
the shadows."

You nervously ask, "Rabbit did a trade. What about you?"

"Just getting to that," he replies. He then presses his hands together, still
clutching the cigarette with thumb and index finger, and smoke rises past his
hidden eyes as he slowly rubs his palms together. He mutters something rhythmic
to himself and you realize it's a song, and you can't quite make out the lyrics,
but the melody is simple and makes you think of Johnny Cash and the end of the
world. And then he stops, and pulls his hands apart, and in each he holds a
talent.

"Here we have luck," he says, bobbing the left, "and scent. And look, I'll be
straight with you. These are precious things and I can't afford whatever blue
light special deal the bunny gave you. I need double his price. I need two
memories to part with one of these. Oh, and they're worth it, believe me. Both
have saved my ass more times than you'd believe. Both could save yours. But it's

Your grandma's stories: The Coyote touches your fingertips and pulls the memory
of your grandma's stories through your nerve endings. "Good," he says, "I'll
take that, although it's not enough to complete the trade."

Somewhere inside you, things are shifting, moving, growing.

Your shit job: The Coyote nods. "Yes," he says, "a fair trade." And something
happens inside you as he says it. The memory of your shit job shifts and
wriggles and fades away and it's still there, but now it's shifted, become
something else. And, yeah, it kinda does feel like you could call it scent.
Cool. He tucks the other talent back in his jacket, and without its faint glow,
it seems darker than ever, the pulsing red tip of his cigarette all you can see.

"The last of us is coming," Coyote's voice says out of the black, "last and most
powerful, and most dangerous, and most afraid. Sand-dancer. Be careful of him,
Knock. Stay brave. Keep your nose to the wind. Remember the shadows."

And it seems like he's growing, larger and larger, the red tip of his cigarette
pulsing and glowing now high up in the sky, and you stumble back, shivering, and
suddenly remember your flashlight in your hand and switch it on...

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand; far above you,
a red warning light blinks on and off. A tumbleweed drifts lazily against the
rusted metal among scrawny weeds and bits of trash. Someone left a tin can here
years ago: ridged ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the glow of the
building.

Open Desert
Clouds of dust swirl through the air, and god damn it's dark.

You can sort of see a dull grey boulder, a low bluff, and some clumps of
sagebrush.

And then you blink, and realize he's not a coyote after all. Just... just a guy.

He wears a couple of days of stubble, a scuffed and faded denim jacket, and,
ridiculously in the darkness, a pair of cheap sunglasses. He lights a cigarette,
then holds up a hand in annoyance to block your flashlight beam. "Turn that
thing off," he says, and either you do it or it goes off by itself, because the
next thing you know, it's darker and he's closer and the only light comes from
the red glow of the cigarette.

"That's better," he says. He takes a drag on the cigarette, then pulls another
from behind his ear and offers it to you. "Smoke?"

You could say yes or say no.

It's freezing out and your nerves are jangled. "Sure, I could use a smoke" you
say.

"Out of smokes, eh?" he says, and hands you his last cigarette, and leans
forward for you to light up off him. His sunglasses reflect back nothing but
your own face weirdly lit by the glow from the cig, and for a moment it's like
the blackness behind them is deep, deeper than the sky, deeper than the
universe...

The coyote stares at you momentarily before gazing out at the horizon.
"Gotta keep an eye on the horizon," he says in a scratchy, slow voice. "Always
someone hunting. Border Patrol, National Guard, INS, ICE, Minutemen. You want to
help people get where they're going out here, you need more than strength. You
need to learn how to hide."

"I'm the Coyote," he says, "And we've been hiding from each other for a long
time."

You could ask for advice, ask who he is, ask about the rabbit, or ask about
trading.

There are dark spirits who roam the earth, little Knock. Grandma used to say
that, holding you tight and stroking your hair. There are dark spirits who roam
the earth, but you're not alone. Oh, no. I'm here. (She'd kiss your head and
you'd squeeze her back.) But others are watching out for you too. You have three
animal guardians, hmm? Spirits who are always watching over you. Oh, you can't
always trust them to know what's best. Remember that, Knock. But when you need
help, they'll come, and protect you from the worser things in the world.

Mom would yell at Grandma a lot for filling your head with that new-age
bullshit. Grandma grew up white and midwestern and Baptist, but had started
wearing things with feathers and playing the pan flute by the time you were
born. She seemed to really like having a son-in-law who was Native American or
American Indian or Indigenous People or whatever she'd decided the term was that
week, and she was pretty pissed when Mom left him. Anyway. Her stories were
mostly BS, you guess, but some of them stuck with you. When it's dark you still
wonder if your spirit animals are out there, somewhere, and what the hell is
taking them so long to find you.

Juza straddles the 371 like a drunk at last call, smelly and without a plan for

or directions (hint: not this way). No one ever stops for the stalls selling
food and jewelry and blankets and cheap t-shirts that cluster around the dirt
turn-off onto the rez. At least, no one buying anything.

Big Jimmy shook his head when he heard you lived in Oro Oeste. Hell of a drive,
kid, he said, popping up his Lumberjacks cap to scratch the straw pate
underneath. You should get a place in Hoo-zuh. Little Jimmy'll set you up in
that trailer cross the road for almost nothin'.

Almost nothing. Yeah, exactly what you'd turn into on the cold day in hell you

You walk north.

Base of the Tower
Behind the concrete building a steel girder rises from the sand, one of three
legs of the huge electrical tower looming like some gargantuan spider into
blackness above you. A tumbleweed drifts lazily against the rusted metal among
scrawny weeds and bits of trash. Someone left a tin can here years ago: ridged
ripples run down its rusty side.

The desert stretches in all directions except back south towards the building.

Something about the tumbleweed makes you want to brood about your last day of
high school.

You didn't expect it was going to be your last day. But that morning you got
called in to the principal's office and fat bald Mr. Cox and pissy old Mrs.
Burke were there, and they looked kind of like strong animals stalking weak
animals, and you knew something bad was up.

Cox said I have here, Mr. Morales (a bad start since you hate that name) a test
you took last week in Mrs. Burke's sophomore English class. Questions have been
raised (he looked up at Mrs. Burke like he was trying to pass the buck)
questions have been raised about the quality of your essay, and whether a
student with your academic and behavioral record (he scratched his bloated nose
meaningfully) could have plausibly produced such as essay, and you get the idea.
They thought you cheated.

No. They knew you cheated, deep in their smug empty hearts. The wanted you to
admit it, say you were a cheater and a liar. But you weren't. You wrote the
essay, every god damn word, because you really liked the book for once and
wanted to show Mrs. Burke that maybe if they gave people better books to read
kids would actually learn something. But they wanted a confession. They wanted a
thieving example they could parade in front of the school. Someone of your
academic and behavioral and economic and racial background and yeah, screw this
shit. So you got up and left and never came back. Drop out, hell. You walked out
and you'd do it again.

Something about the rusted key makes you want to brood about meeting Ocean.

She was buying a Fresca at Big Jimmy's when you got off your shift, shoving work
keys in your pocket, and you stood behind her waiting to get some cigs, almost
too tired to notice how cute she was but still noticing, yeah, still noticing.

She turned around and caught you noticing and you were pretty embarrassed and
covered in sweat and grease from the garage, so you stepped up and bought some
Camels and were pretty surprised that she was still there when you turned
around.

She told you her name was Ocean Running Deer and she lived on the rez and you
told her your name was Nakaibito Morales and you lived in Oro Oeste. She said
isn't Nakaibito the name of a town off west and you told her your mom had picked
it off a map because it sounded like a good Indian name. You never tell anyone
that story but for some reason you told her. She laughed, sweetly though, and
said maybe the two of you should go there sometime and see what is was like.
Somehow two weeks later you were dating although you never ended up going to
Nakaibito.

And now... no, you can't think about that yet.

Whatcha watchin, Knock? he asked, lurching out of mom's room smelling of sage
incense and holding a beer and crashing into the lazyboy, and you said Nothing
Mr Morales (and god damn it kid, can't you at least call me Karl if you won't
call me dad? but that conversation's been buried a year now at least out loud)
and he squinted and said is this that Family Guy crap? I thought your mother
said she didn't want you watching this crap (because it's always mother who
wants you to do things or be things or say things, never Mr Morales) I thought
your mother said you ought to start learning about your culture.

So while Peter is trying to start a rock band or something Karl starts spouting
some story about Mexican myths with eagles and feathered serpent gods, and he
must be so into the stepdad thing he's forgotten that's his culture, not yours
(well, sort of). Not that your real dad or Peter Griffin ever helped you figure
out what your culture's supposed to be either. It hits you that your culture
must be somewhere in the middle, between Family Guy and Quetzalcoatl, and you
start laughing and get grounded because you can't even imagine what the middle
between those two could possibly look like.

This concrete building must've been some sort of utility structure for the huge

Juza straddles the 371 like a drunk at last call, smelly and without a plan for
the future. Shiny cars whiz by at ninety once in a while, only stopping for gas
or directions (hint: not this way). No one ever stops for the stalls selling
food and jewelry and blankets and cheap t-shirts that cluster around the dirt
turn-off onto the rez. At least, no one buying anything.

Big Jimmy shook his head when he heard you lived in Oro Oeste. Hell of a drive,
kid, he said, popping up his Lumberjacks cap to scratch the straw pate
underneath. You should get a place in Hoo-zuh. Little Jimmy'll set you up in
that trailer cross the road for almost nothin'.

Almost nothing. Yeah, exactly what you'd turn into on the cold day in hell you
move to Juza. But on the other hand, that was before you met Ocean. Now the road
back to Oro Oeste seems longer and longer every night.

You walk north.

Middle of Nowhere
The tire tracks from the south stop abruptly here, but where the hell are you?
The desert sand and clumps of pale sagebrush are all your dimming headlights
pick out before barely reaching the concrete building to the north.

Your poor old pickup truck ticks and groans, smashed gracelessly against a tall
Saguaro; whiffs of evaporating gasoline linger in the chill air.

A brown-colored lizard clings to the cactus.

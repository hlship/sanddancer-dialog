# Sand-dancer in Dialog

This is a re-implementation of Aaron Reed's Sand-dancer, in 
[Dialog](https://linusakesson.net/dialog/index.php).

Essentially, I'm following along [his book](https://www.amazon.com/Creating-Interactive-Fiction-Inform-7/dp/1435455061), chapter by chapter,
creating a roughly equivalent implementation using Dialog.
Some, but far from all, of the optional parts are implemented.

Special thanks to Daniel Stelzer for [working out how to handling parsing](https://intfiction.org/t/understanding-complicated-numbers/46769/2).

Currently tested against Dialog `0m/01`.

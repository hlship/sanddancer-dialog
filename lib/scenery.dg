%% (scenery $) is for objects that provide some detail but should not be interracted with.

%% This may be the wrong approach; instead, scenery may be distinct from items
%% and we should revisit this when we start adding room descriptions.  Essentially,
%% the scenery descriptions can be integrated into the room description itself.
%% Right now they are items so that they can be listed.

(item *(scenery $))

(fine where it is *(scenery $))
